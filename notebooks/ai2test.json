{"text":"A bonus-skimming scandal in 2008 destroyed the FACILITY' international scouting department, which didn't make a significant signing for another five years. That drought ended with PERSON, who signed for $1.6 million out of the ORGANIZATION as ORGANIZATION's No. 2-rated prospect in the 2013-14 international crop (behind only current organizationmate PERSON). PERSON and hamate injuries ruined his first two full years as a pro before he ranked fifth in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 16 homers in 2017 -- though that season ended two weeks early when he punched a dugout door in frustration and broke his left pinky.PERSON has two exceptional tools in his raw power and his arm. His combination of bat speed, strength and loft and leverage in his right-handed swing gives him massive pop to all fields. He still needs to make more consistent contact, though he improved last year when he started to recognize pitches better and became less pull-conscious.PERSON has the best arm strength among GPE's position prospects, further enhancing his right-field profile. He has average speed and should be an average defender on an outfield corner. He was diagnosed with a torn flexor muscle and a strained ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow during Spring Training, then played well with the injury until the FACILITY shut him down in July so he could get PERSON surgery in time to be ready for 2019.","label":"MiLB"}
{"text":"As a freshman and sophomore, PERSON was one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in his high school class and looked like a potential top-two-rounds pick. Now that the 2015 PERSON has arrived, he won't go quite that high, but he still has a quality fastball and the makings of some effective secondary pitches. PERSON will show a 94-96 mph fastball early in games before settling in at 89-93 mph with some cut and sink. His low-80s slider is his No. 2 option and features good tilt at times. His upper-70s curveball is effective when he stays on top of it, and he also exhibits some feel for a changeup with fading action. A ORGANIZATION recruit, PERSON has the athleticism to deliver strikes but little projection remaining in his 6-foot-1 frame. Scouts aren't fond of his high-three-quarters delivery and long arm action, which gives hitters a good look at his pitches.","label":"MiLB"}
{"text":"He lacks strength\/bat speed but ORGANIZATION is more athletic than the typical catcher, and he's starting to put together an interesting plate discipline track record. He remains more of a developmental, slow burn prospect, but he's trending up.","label":"MiLB"}
{"text":"PERSON signed for the fifth highest bonus in the 2017 July 2nd class, among a few already-elite prospects like ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON shortstop PERSON, PERSON outfielder PERSON and ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON. PERSON could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the ORGANIZATION the same name who was also born in the same year. The ORGANIZATION' PERSON has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 ORGANIZATION, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff PERSON too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which PERSON could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that PERSON has become close friends with PERSON; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in GSP. PERSON will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the ORGANIZATION' PERSON did this past year; that PERSON reached High-A at age 18.","label":"MiLB"}

{"text":" The ORGANIZATION of the 2012 ORGANIZATION II College World Series after tossing a pair of shutouts to lead LOCATION (Pa.) to the national title, PERSON signed for $65,000 as an 18th-round pick the following June. He has advanced rapidly, reaching Double-A early in his second full professional season before being sent to the ORGANIZATION in June in return for PERSON Aza.PERSON works from a low three-quarters arm slot that adds run and sink to a fastball that clocks at 90-94 mph when he's fresh. It also produces a sweeping slider that can be tough on right-handers. He also has a fringy changeup that he doesn't trust as much as his two main pitches. The ORGANIZATION had used PERSON as both a starter and reliever, and he's more likely to fill the latter role in the big leagues. He fills the strike zone and keeps the ball down, though he must prove he can maintain his velocity over a full year after it faded in the second half of 2014.","label":"MiLB"}
{"text":"  Drafted out of GPE in the 31st round in 2011, PERSON has earned a reputation as a solid defensive catcher. He showed the ORGANIZATION enough in two years with Double-A Arkansas to get added to the club's 40-man roster following the 2014 season and he made his big league debut after a solid Triple-A season in 2015.With a big frame behind the plate, PERSON does a good job of receiving and blocking balls in the dirt. While he has thrown out 33 percent of would-be basestealers in his ORGANIZATION career, he has a long release and has often been tested by runners. At the plate, he hunts fastballs and has the power to drive balls. But his aggressive approach and long swing limit his ability to make consistent hard contact, though he did so at a greater rate in 2015.PERSON's defense and game management give him a chance to become a solid backup catcher in the big leagues, even if his bat doesn't develop further.","label":"MiLB"}

PERSON is athletic and brandishes good bat speed with occasional flashes of power. He runs really well and has the instincts to make plus defensive plays in the field.

{"text":" PERSON captured scouts' attention on last summer's showcase circuit with his hitting ability. He has good bat-to-ball skills and produces plenty of line drives. He uses a high kick as a timing mechanism in his swing, but when he is timed up, he produces consistent, hard contact. Scouts expect him to develop more power as he physically matures.  PERSON is a fringy runner and his arm strength has been hampered by a shoulder injury he suffered last year. He is a capable outfielder and likely fits best in left field.  A GPE native, PERSON transferred to The FACILITY and ORGANIZATION in GPE, Fla., for his senior year of high school. He is committed to GPE.","label":"MiLB"}
{"text":"In 2012, a LOCATION CC southpaw rode a surge of velocity into the second round of the GPE. PERSON is repeating itself this year, and while he may not go quite as high as PERSON did, PERSON has a better breaking ball at the same stage. He has backed out of a commitment to GPE, so he'll return to the ORGANIZATION for his sophomore season if he doesn't turn pro.PERSON had a low-80s fastball as a ORGANIZATION high school junior in 2017 and improved to the mid-80s as a senior before jumping to 90-93 mph at times as a junior college freshman. There were games when he operated more in the upper 80s, but he's still growing into his lanky 6-foot-5 frame and could sit in the mid-90s with sink once he's fully developed. He also shows an affinity for spinning a curveball, though he sometimes has trouble staying on top of it because he employs a lower-three-quarters arm slot.PERSON also displays some feel for a changeup, giving him the potential for a nice three-pitch mix. He's still figuring out how to keep his long arms and legs in sync in his delivery, and he has trouble finding the strike zone when he can't. He needs a lot of polish but has more upside than most left-handers in this GPE.","label":"MiLB"}
