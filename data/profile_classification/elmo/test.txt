from   a   raw   tools   perspective ,    there   may   not   have   been   anyone   more   enticing   in   the   2017   draft   class   than   adell .    the   kentucky   high   school   star   was   his   state ' s   gatorade   player   of   the   year   and   led   all   high   school   hitters   with   25   home   runs .    while   there   was   some   concern   about   his   ability   to   hit ,    the   angels   liked   the   upside   enough   to   take   him   no .    10   overall   and   sign   him   for   full   pick   value .    he   then   went   out   and   showed   off   all   of   those   tools   across   two   levels   of   rookie   ball   during   his   pro   debut ,    and   kept   on   doing   it   across   two   levels   of   a   ball   in   his   first   full   season ,    earning   a   trip   to   the   futures   game   in   the   process .       while   no   one   questions   adell ' s   raw   power   and   bat   speed   from   the   right   side ,    some   were   concerned   with   his   ability   to   make   enough   contact   to   tap   into   it   due   to   some   swing - and - miss   tendencies   that   showed   up   against   top   competition   on   the   summer   showcase   circuit .    there   were   some   strikeouts   during   his   debut ,    but   he   impressed   the   angels   with   his   ability   to   make   adjustments   and   drive   the   ball   to   all   fields .    a   tremendous   athlete   with   plus   speed ,    adell   has   the   chance   to   continue   to   be   a   basestealing   threat   long   term .    it   also   helps   give   him   plenty   of   range   to   patrol   center ,    though   he   didn ' t   play   the   outfield   last   summer   because   of   a   minor   shoulder   issue .    his   plus   arm ,    which   fired   upper - 90s   fastballs   from   the   mound   in   high   school ,    would   also   work   in   right .       even   with   the   exciting   debut ,    patience   will   be   key   in   the   dynamic   outfielder ' s   development .    if   it   all   continues   to   click ,    he   could   develop   into   the   kind   of   all - star   performer   teams   hope   to   get   with   their   first - round   selections .

sometimes   repeating   a   level   can   do   wonders   for   a   prospect ' s   career .    case   in   point   is   leyba ,    who   had   to   go   back   to   the   california   league   after   scuffling   there   in   2015 .    the   former   tigers   farmhand ,    who   came   to   the   d - backs   in   the   three - team   trade   that   sent   didi   gregorius   to   the   yankees ,    hit   his   way   out   of   the   level   in   2016   and   kept   on   performing   well   in   double - a ,    all   at   the   age   of   20 .    however ,    his   progress   was   slowed   in   2017   by   a   shoulder   injury   that   kept   him   out   of   action   for   a   couple   of   months .          leyba   excels   with   an   innate   ability   to   find   the   barrel   of   the   bat ,    especially   from   the   left   side   of   the   plate .    he ' s   a   free   swinger   with   tremendous   hand - eye   coordination ,    but   one   of   the   keys   to   his   step   forward   last   season   was   improved   plate   discipline   and   a   better   walk   rate .    that   allowed   him   to   increase   his   extra - base   output ,    and   he   could   eventually   be   a   10 - 12   home   run   kind   of   hitter .    leyba   has   played   more   shortstop   than   anywhere   else   since   joining   the   organization   and   can   make   all   the   plays   there .    he ' s   also   shown   the   ability   to   play   a   more - than - capable   second   base .          leyba   raised   the   bar   a   bit   following   his   first   full   season   in   the   organization   but   didn ' t   get   to   replicate   it   because   of   injury   in   2017 .    he   still   has   the   potential   to   be   an   everyday   shortstop ,    but   he   could   also   move   around   to   create   more   opportunities   to   get   his   bat   into   the   lineup   once   he ' s   ready   for   the   big   leagues . 
after   helping   lead   stony   brook   on   its   cinderella   run   to   the   college   world   series   in   2012 ,    jankowski   led   the   california   league   with   71   stolen   bases   in   his   first   full   professional   season .    his   progress   was   slowed   in   2014   by   a   fractured   left   wrist   that   sidelined   him   for   nearly   three   months ,    though   he   was   able   to   return   to   action   for   double - a   san   antonio   in   the   second   half .       more   than   just   a   speedster ,    jankowski   has   a   knack   for   putting   the   barrel   on   the   ball   and   has   good   on - base   skills .    he   has   minimal   power ,    but   his   high   contact   rate   and   speed   make   him   a   prototypical   leadoff   hitter .          jankowski   takes   good   routes   in   the   outfield ,    which ,    combined   with   his   speed ,    makes   him   an   excellent   defender .    he   still   has   to   prove   his   bat   is   good   enough   against   advanced   pitching ,    but   his   defense ,    speed   and   leadoff   skills   could   be   enough   to   make   him   an   everyday   center   fielder .

garcia   was   already   20   when   he   signed   with   the   pirates   in   february   2013   and   he   didn ' t   make   his   organizational   debut   until   2014   in   the   dominican   summer   league .    given   his   age ,    the   pirates   pushed   him   aggressively   with   an   assignment   to   the   full - season   south   atlantic   league   for   his   united   states   debut .    the   big   right - hander   started   in   the    ' pen ,    then   took   off   as   a   starter ,    finishing   fourth   in   the   minors   in   era .       garcia   pitches   largely   off   of   his   fastball   and   it ' s   a   big   one ,    touching   98 - 99   mph   during   his   stint   in   the   sal   all - star   game   and   sitting   in   the   mid - 90s .    he ' ll   both   miss   bats   and   generate   ground - ball   outs   with   it .    he ' ll   complement   the   heater   with   a   hard   slider .    he   has   a   changeup ,    but   has   exhibited   a   limited   feel   for   it   ths   far .    he   doesn ' t   have   the   cleanest   delivery   in   the   world ,    but   nothing   that   raises   major   red   flags   and   he ' s   generally   around   the   strike   zone .       because   of   his   physicality ,    garcia   does   have   a   chance   to   start   and   he   continued   to   do   so   effectively   in   2016 .    but   his   fastball - slider   combination   could   get   him   to   the   big   leagues   quickly   if   the   pirates   decide   to   go   that   route . 
hess   worked   mostly   as   a   reliever   during   his   first   two   years   at   tennessee   tech   before   sliding   into   the   starting   rotation   as   a   junior   in   2014 .    the   right - hander   took   to   the   role   immediately ,    and   the   orioles   made   him   their   fifth - round   pick   in   june .    he   continued   to   make   strides   in   his   first   full   season ,    overcoming   a   shaky   start   at   class   a   advanced   frederick   to   dominate   during   the   second   half   and   earn   a   late   promotion   to   double - a   bowie .    hess   went   7 - 1   with   1 . 80   era   over   his   final   12   regular - season   starts   and   then   starred   in   the   eastern   league   playoffs ,    winning   both   of   his   starts   and   allowing   one   earned   run   in   14   innings .    unfortunately   for   hess ,    he   hasn ' t   fared   nearly   as   well   this   season   in   his   return   to   bowie .       hess '    feel   for   pitching   steadily   improved   in   2015 ,    and   by   the   end   of   the   season   he   was   pounding   the   zone   with   his   entire   four - pitch   mix .    his   over - the - top   release   point   helps   him   achieve   consistent   downhill   plane   with   his   fastball ,    which   sits   in   the   low   to   mid - 90s   and   touches   97 .    both   his   slider   and   curveball   took   a   step   forward   last   year ,    though   neither   projects   to   be   above   average ,    and   he   can   get   caught   between   them   at   times .    he   also   has   a   serviceable   changeup   that   plays   against   left - handed   hitters .       questions   remain   about   whether   hess   could   remain   a   starter   given   his   high - effort   delivery   and   lack   of   an   out   pitch .    but   the   significant   improvement   of   his   secondary   pitches   last   season   helped   his   cause ,    and   club   officials   believe   he   can   develop   into   at   least   a   no .    4   starter .

kubitza   starred   at   texas   state   for   three   years   before   the   braves   selected   him   in   the   third   round   of   the   2011   draft ,    making   him   the   highest   drafted   position   player   in   school   history .    he   has   a   patient   approach   at   the   plate   and   understands   the   strike   zone   well .    he   is   still   susceptible   to   strikeouts ,    however ,    as   his   swing   has   a   tendency   to   get   long .    kubitza   produces   good   power   and   looks   to   drive   balls   into   the   gaps .    kubitza   has   improved   defensively   since   joining   the   professional   ranks   and   is   now   solid   at   third   base .    he   has   a   strong   arm   and   good   hands .    kubitza   has   rebounded   this   season   at   class   a   advanced   lynchburg ,    reclaiming   his   prospect   status   after   a   disappointing   full - season   debut   in   2012 . 
ryan   was   viewed   as   a   better   position   prospect   than   a   pitcher   as   a   high   school   senior ,    even   though   he   could   pump   a   mid - 90s   fastball .    he   passed   on   signing   with   the   indians   as   a   40th - round   pick   in   2014   and   honored   his   commitment   to   north   carolina ,    where   he   struggled   at   the   plate   and   made   only   one   appearance   on   the   mound   before   leaving   the   team   in   2016 .    the   indians   took   ryan   in   the   30th   round   that   june ,    signing   him   for    $ 100 , 000 ,    then   dealt   him   to   the   mets   a   little   more   than   a   year   later   in   exchange   for   jay   bruce .    he   excelled   at   class   a   advanced   st .    lucie   early   in   the   2018   season ,    earning   florida   state   league   all - star   honors   along   with   a   promotion   to   double - a .       ryan   shows   power   stuff   out   of   the   bullpen .    he ' ll   sit   at   95 - 96   mph   and   touch   98   with   a   riding   fastball   that   he   pairs   with   a   low - to - mid - 80s   slider   that   has   a   high   spin   rate   and   earns   above - average   grades   from   scouts .    he   also   has   a   changeup ,    but   it ' s   a   distant   third   pitch   that   he   seldom   throws .    after   issuing   3 . 6   walks   per   nine   in   his   first   full   season ,    ryan   made   strides   with   both   his   control   and   command   in   2018   while   trimming   his   walk   rate   to   2 . 5 .    the   gains   ryan   made   with   his   breaking   ball   and   overall   feel   for   pitching   last   season   bode   well   for   his   chances   of   reaching   the   major   leagues   as   a   middle   reliever   capable   of   working   multiple   frames .

in   his   brief   time   as   a   pro ,    perkins   has   shown   a   knack   for   doing   one   thing   very   well :    hit .    and   as   most   baseball   people   will   tell   you :    if   you   can   hit ,    you ' ll   likely   find   a   job   in   the   big   leagues .    perkins   was   raking   in   the   florida   state   league   during   his   first   full   season   in   2013   before   a   broken   wrist   forced   him   out   for   a   month .    he   has   a   knack   for   making   consistent   hard   contact ,    and   with   a   6 - foot - 5   frame ,    he   should   add   strength ,    which   should   lead   to   some   of   his   doubles   clearing   fences .    perkins '    other   tools   won ' t   jump   out   at   you ,    but   he   has   the   skills   to   be   a   decent   corner   outfielder .    perkins   has   played   some   corner   infield   in   the   past ,    and   he   could   get   another   look   there ,    but   it ' s   his   ability   to   swing   the   bat   that   will   continue   to   propel   him   up   the   ladder . 
both   of   lefty   jamie   moyer ' s   kids   were   drafted   as   infielders .    older   son   dillon   is   now   trying   to   transition   to   the   mound   with   the   dodgers ,    while   younger   son   hutton   parlayed   a   solid   junior   season   at   pepperdine   to   land   in   the   seventh   round   of   the   2015   draft .    a   quick   start   in   the   midwest   league   earned   him   a   promotion   in   his   first   full   year .       moyer   has   shown   some   ability   with   the   bat .    he   hit   14   homers   in   the   west   coast   conference   as   a   junior   at   pepperdine   and ,    with   an   aggressive   approach   at   the   plate ,    the   switch - hitter   exhibited   extra - base   pop   in   his   brief   pro   career .    he   might   need   to   refine   his   approach   if   he   wants   to   use   that   power   consistently   and   hit   for   a   decent   average   as   he   moves   up   the   ladder .    an   average   runner ,    moyer   played   mostly   second   base   during   his   pro   debut ,    but   saw   ample   time   at   shortstop   and   third   in   2016 .       that   might   set   moyer   up   well   for   a   career   as   a   utility   man ,    one   who   swings   the   bat   well   and   can   play   three   infield   positions .    perhaps   he   has   the   ceiling   of   an   offensive - minded   second   baseman ,    but   super - subs   like   that   can   play   a   long   time   in   the   big   leagues .

kaprielian   was   viewed   as   one   of   the   more   advanced   college   hurlers   in   the   2015   draft   following   an   impressive   career   at   ucla   that   included   a   national   championship    ( 2013 )  .    the   yankees   took   kaprielian   16th   overall ,    making   him   the   highest - drafted   college   pitcher   in   franchise   history ,    and   then   signed   him   for    $ 2 . 65   million .    unfortunately ,    injuries   have   subsequently   derailed   kaprielian ' s   development ,    as   a   strained   flexor   muscle   in   his   forearm   limited   him   to   just   three   starts   in   is   first   full   season ,    while   tommy   john   surgery   the   following   spring   wiped   out   his   entire   2017   campaign .    it   will   now   be   up   to   the   a ' s   to   get   kaprielian   back   on   track   after   they   acquired   him ,    dustin   fowler   and   jorge   mateo   for   sonny   gray   at   the   trade   deadline .       after   working   at   88 - 92   mph   in   college   with   a   fastball   that   stood   out   more   for   its   sink   and   command   than   it   did   for   velocity ,    kaprielian   saw   his   velocity   jump   to   93 - 96   mph   while   touching   99   upon   entering   pro   ball .    he   possesses   a   deep   secondary   arsenal ,    including   a   curveball ,    slider   and   changeup   that   all   grade   as   at   least   above - average   pitches   when   they ' re   on .    kaprielian   controls   and   commands   his   pitches   very   well ,    doing   a   good   job   of   delivering   all   of   them   from   the   same   arm   slot .       considered   more   of   a   pitchability   right - hander   with   a   ceiling   of   a   no .    3   starter   when   the   yankees   drafted   him ,    kaprielian   has   shown   frontline   stuff   when   healthy .    he ' s   fallen   well   behind   the   development   curve   and   will   have   his   workload   monitored   carefully   moving   forward ,    but   the   overall   ingredients   are   there   for   kaprielian   to   still   move   quickly   once   he   finally   returns   to   the   mound ,    likely   in   mid - 2018 . 
all   field   has   done   anywhere   he ' s   played    -  -    from   bishop   gorman   high   school   in   nevada   to   the   university   of   arizona   to   his   first   year - plus   of   pro   ball    -  -    is   hit   and   prove   people   wrong .    he   did   just   that   in   his   first   full   season   in   2014 ,    playing   across   two   levels   and   earning   organizational   player   of   the   year   honors .    the   numbers   in   2015   weren ' t   as   impressive ,    though   he   still   showed   a   surprising   power - speed   combination .       an   undersized   outfielder   with   plus   makeup   and   work   ethic ,    field   maximizes   the   tools   he   does   have .    he   does   have   a   good   approach   at   the   plate   with   decent   bat   speed   and   has   shown   surprising   pop   at   the   plate .    he ' s   an   average   runner ,    but   his   instincts   allow   that   to   play   up   on   both   sides   of   the   ball .          the   rays   have   been   pleased   with   how   field   has   looked   in   center ,    but   he   sees   time   in   all   three   outfield   spots .    he   profiles   best   as   a   fourth - outfielder   type ,    but   it ' s   never   a   good   idea   to   limit   an   overachiever   like   field . 
osich   was   a   starter   at   oregon   state   and   threw   a   no - hitter   to   beat   ucla   and   trevor   bauer   in   2011 .    he   has   battled   injuries   throughout   his   career   and   underwent   tommy   john   surgery   in   2010 .    his   health   issues   scared   teams   again   on   the   eve   of   the   2011   draft   when   he   was   pulled   from   his   start   in   the   ncaa   tournament   after   one   inning   because   of   elbow   and   back   discomfort .    osich   has   major   league   stuff   when   he ' s   healthy   and   could   be   a   starter .    his   injury   history ,    however ,    makes   him   a   better   fit   in   the   bullpen ,    where   his   power   arsenal   makes   him   a   potential   high - impact   reliever .    osich   throws   his   fastball   in   the   upper - 90s   and   mixes   it   with   a   solid   slider   and   changeup .    he   reached   double - a   richmond   this   year   and   is   moving   quickly   toward   san   francisco . 
looking   to   add   more   experienced   college   arms   to   an   already   pitching - rich   system ,    the   a ' s   doubled   down   on   a   pair   of   florida   hurlers   early   in   the   2016   draft ,    selecting   a . j .    puk   seventh   overall   and   then   nabbing   shore   in   the   second   round .    though   puk   was   considered   the   more    " famous "    of   the   duo ,    it   was   shore   who   was   the   gators '    friday   night   starter   for   all   three   years   of   his   college   career .    as   a   junior ,    he   was   named   sec   pitcher   of   the   year   after   going   12 - 1   with   a   2 . 31   era   in   18   starts .    strong   and   durable ,    shore   is   a   strike - throwing   machine   with   a   potential   three - pitch   mix .    he   typically   works   with   an   average   fastball   velocity - wise ,    sitting   at   88 - 92   mph   with   ground - ball - inducing   sinking   action ,    but   it   plays   up   because   of   his   command .    his   best   pitch   is   his   well - above - average   changeup ,    which   he   locates   and   sinks   extremely   well ,    and   it   aids   his   effectiveness   against   left - handed   hitters .    shore ' s   breaking   ball   has   improved   but   remains   inconsistent   in   terms   of   both   shape   and   pace .    when   it ' s   right ,    however ,    the   pitch   can   be   virtually   unhittable   and   has   the   potential   of   being   a   third   major   league   average   offering .    shore   will   always   stand   out   more   for   his   pitchability   than   stuff .    a   lack   of   an   explosive   fastball   limits   his   ceiling ,    but   there ' s   certainly   a   lot   to   like   in   a   proven   college   performer   who   should   be   quick   to   the   big   leagues ,    where   he ' s   likely   to   serve   as   an   effective   no .    4   starter   capable   of   eating   innings . 
when   the   giants   made   gonzalez   a   second - round   pick   last   june ,    it   meant   he   went   two   rounds   earlier   than   his   father   luis   did   in   1988   before   becoming   a   five - time   all - star   and   a   world   series   hero .    after   passing   on   his   commitment   to   texas   christian   to   sign   for   a   below - slot    $ 950 , 000 ,    he   burst   into   pro   ball   with   14   hits   in   his   first   five   games .    he   finished   third   in   the   rookie - level   arizona   league   batting   race   at    . 339   and   played   better   defense   than   expected .    though   gonzalez   had   some   of   the   best   right - handed   raw   power   among   high   schoolers   in   the   2017   draft ,    he   just   focused   on   making   quality   contact   in   his   debut .    he   showed   advanced   pitch - recognition   skills ,    controlled   the   strike   zone   and   used   an   inside - out   swing   to   drill   line   drives   from   gap   to   gap .    as   he   gets   stronger   and   turns   on   more   pitches ,    he   should   start   producing   more   home   runs .    while   gonzalez   is   a   below - average   runner   with   modest   arm   strength ,    he   does   have   soft   hands   and   san   francisco   believes   he   can   stay   at   third   base   if   he   improves   his   footwork   and   range .    he   has   good   instincts   and   the   work   ethic   to   get   better .    if   he   has   to   move ,    he   still   might   produce   enough   offensively   to   profile   at   first   base   or   in   left   field .
