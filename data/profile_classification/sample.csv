"Schnell helped lead Roncalli (Indianapolis) High to an Indiana 4-A state championship in 2016 and took home the state's Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in '18 after hitting .535 with 15 home runs. He became the first player in program history to be chosen in the Draft when the Rays took him with the No. 32 overall pick that June, and he signed for slightly above slot at $2.3 million to forgo his Louisville commitment. Assigned to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League for his pro debut, Schnell homered in his first ever plate appearance but produced an overall line of .239/.378/.373 over 19 games.  Schnell has a sound left-handed swing and uses the entire field. Though he has mostly gap power right now, he has the solid bat speed and wiry strength to develop average power once he fills out his extremely projectable frame. He currently has above-average speed, bordering on plus, but many evaluators believe he'll lose a step as he gets stronger. Schnell also offers a well-rounded defensive package. He has the speed and instincts to stick in center field and arm strength -- he showed a fastball that reached the low-90s in high school -- that's suitable for right now. He has a higher ceiling in center, as a move to a corner spot would come with greater offensive demands."
"Deetz hurt his elbow in summer ball before his high school senior season, had Tommy John surgery and redshirted for a year at Northeastern Oklahoma JC before returning to the mound in 2014. His fastball hit 98 mph that spring, prompting the Astros to draft him in the 11th round, and he bounced between the rotation and bullpen in his first four years as a pro. He drew an 80-game suspension in January 2018 after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance, excelled as a full-time reliever after his return and made his big league debut in September.  Deetz worked mostly as a tandem starter before he reached Triple-A, where he got hit hard taking a normal turn in a rotation. As a starter, he operated with a low-90s fastball that peaked at 95 mph and a low-80s slider with a big break. His stuff kicked up when he took a relief role, with his heater parking at 94-97 mph and reaching 99 mph while his slider sat in the mid-80s with sharper break. After struggling to develop a changeup, Deetz focused on his two main pitches once he shifted to the bullpen. While his fastball and slider can be overpowering in short stints, he still has yet to prove he can control and command them on a consistent basis. He has 59 walks in 79 Triple-A innings and will have to locate his pitches better to find a role in Houston."
"Drafted out of High Point University as a red-shirt junior who had Tommy John surgery, Schultz has shown a combination of intriguing stuff and subpar command in his brief pro career. That, plus his 5-foot-10, 200-pound frame, have some believing he's a reliever long-term, though the Rays continue to allow him to develop as a starter. Schultz has a power arsenal that misses bats consistently. His fastball touches the mid-90s and features considerable arm-side run, and he combines it with a power breaking ball and a potentially average changeup. As good as his swing-and-miss stuff is, he struggles finding the strike zone, walking 5.6 batters per nine innings heading into 2016. While he does maintain his velocity into starts and doesn't have a ton of effort in his delivery, most feel Schultz will end up in the bullpen, where he could see an uptick in velocity and serve as an effective short reliever."
"From a raw tools perspective, there may not have been anyone more enticing in the 2017 Draft class than Adell. The Kentucky high school star was his state's Gatorade Player of the Year and led all high school hitters with 25 home runs. While there was some concern about his ability to hit, the Angels liked the upside enough to take him No. 10 overall and sign him for full pick value. He then went out and showed off all of those tools across two levels of rookie ball during his pro debut, and kept on doing it across two levels of A ball in his first full season, earning a trip to the Futures Game in the process.  While no one questions Adell's raw power and bat speed from the right side, some were concerned with his ability to make enough contact to tap into it due to some swing-and-miss tendencies that showed up against top competition on the summer showcase circuit. There were some strikeouts during his debut, but he impressed the Angels with his ability to make adjustments and drive the ball to all fields. A tremendous athlete with plus speed, Adell has the chance to continue to be a basestealing threat long term. It also helps give him plenty of range to patrol center, though he didn't play the outfield last summer because of a minor shoulder issue. His plus arm, which fired upper-90s fastballs from the mound in high school, would also work in right.  Even with the exciting debut, patience will be key in the dynamic outfielder's development. If it all continues to click, he could develop into the kind of All-Star performer teams hope to get with their first-round selections."
"Javier wasn't highly regarded coming out of the Dominican Republic, signing for $10,000 in March 2015, 20 months after he first became eligible. The Astros kept him in Rookie ball for his first two pro seasons before he made his full-season debut in 2017 and helped low Class A Quad Cities win the Midwest League championship.  Javier features some of the best pitchability among the Astros' younger pitching prospects. His pair of quality breaking balls and his ability to mix and spot his pitches allowed him to average 12.0 strikeouts per nine innings this season. His fastball usually ranges from 88-91 mph and tops out at 93, and he also shows aptitude for employing his changeup. Because he doesn't have a lot of projection in his 6-foot-1 frame, Javier probably will have average fastball velocity at best. He'll need to challenge hitters more often at higher levels after his walk rate rose to a career-high 4.1 per nine innings in 2017. If he can't make it as a back-of-the-rotation starter, his slider and curveball could make him a useful right-on-right reliever."
"Cruz was ranked No. 27 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 international prospect list in 2015, and the Braves loved his athleticism and makeup enough to give him $2 million to sign in July of that summer. He responded to their faith with a strong United States debut in the Gulf Coast League before earning a promotion up to the Appalachian League at age 17.   The switch-hitting infielder is a stronger hitter from the right side, where he can make consistent contact with a line-drive swing. It's gap power right now, but he might grow into a little more in the future, especially as he refines his approach. His best offensive tool is his speed, and it's plus, which should allow him to be a basestealing threat. It also helps him cover a lot of ground in the infield, with his range and feet giving him a chance to stay at short. His arm might not. He has fringy arm strength and struggles with his mechanics at times, with some thinking he might end up at second or in center field.   For now, he'll continue to get work at shortstop, where he'll continue trying to live up to the comps to Jose Reyes that were dropped on him when he was an amateur."
"Sometimes repeating a level can do wonders for a prospect's career. Case in point is Leyba, who had to go back to the California League after scuffling there in 2015. The former Tigers farmhand, who came to the D-backs in the three-team trade that sent Didi Gregorius to the Yankees, hit his way out of the level in 2016 and kept on performing well in Double-A, all at the age of 20. However, his progress was slowed in 2017 by a shoulder injury that kept him out of action for a couple of months.   Leyba excels with an innate ability to find the barrel of the bat, especially from the left side of the plate. He's a free swinger with tremendous hand-eye coordination, but one of the keys to his step forward last season was improved plate discipline and a better walk rate. That allowed him to increase his extra-base output, and he could eventually be a 10-12 home run kind of hitter. Leyba has played more shortstop than anywhere else since joining the organization and can make all the plays there. He's also shown the ability to play a more-than-capable second base.   Leyba raised the bar a bit following his first full season in the organization but didn't get to replicate it because of injury in 2017. He still has the potential to be an everyday shortstop, but he could also move around to create more opportunities to get his bat into the lineup once he's ready for the big leagues."
"After helping lead Stony Brook on its Cinderella run to the College World Series in 2012, Jankowski led the California League with 71 stolen bases in his first full professional season. His progress was slowed in 2014 by a fractured left wrist that sidelined him for nearly three months, though he was able to return to action for Double-A San Antonio in the second half.  More than just a speedster, Jankowski has a knack for putting the barrel on the ball and has good on-base skills. He has minimal power, but his high contact rate and speed make him a prototypical leadoff hitter.   Jankowski takes good routes in the outfield, which, combined with his speed, makes him an excellent defender. He still has to prove his bat is good enough against advanced pitching, but his defense, speed and leadoff skills could be enough to make him an everyday center fielder."
"A 39th-round pick out of an Arizona high school in 2010, Brugman turned down the Yankees in order to attend Brigham Young. The Athletics signed him for $50,000 as a 17th-rounder in 2013, and he has gotten off to a better start in pro ball than most members of that A's Draft class. While his arm is his only true plus tool, he doesn't have a glaring weakness. Brugman couples a smooth left-handed swing with good patience at the plate. He has the power potential to hit 15 homers per season at his peak. He's an average runner, though he's not a basestealing threat. Since turning pro, Brugman has seen action at all three outfield spots. He has enough arm strength to play right field but the A's have deployed him mostly in left. While it remains to be seen if Brugman can develop into an everyday player at the big league level, his broad base of tools could make him a useful reserve."
"Nunez played at a loaded Elk Grove (Calif.) High program, where his teammates included future first-round picks Dylan Carlson and Derek Hill plus sluggers J.D. Davis and Rowdy Tellez, who each slammed 23 homers in Double-A in 2016. Signed for an over-slot $800,000 in the sixth round of the 2013 Draft, Nunez played mostly shortstop as a prepster and the middle infield during his pro debut before becoming a full-time catcher in 2014. While his offensive numbers predictably have declined as he has focused on his defense, the Rockies believe in his all-around potential. Nunez has quicker feet than most catchers and soft hands, and he could develop into a solid receiver despite leading the high Class A California League with 19 passed balls in 93 games last year. He has solid arm strength and has improved his transfer and accuracy, raising his caught-stealing percentage from 21 percent in 2015 to 43 percent a year ago. Add his leadership skills to the package, and he already has become the best defensive catcher in the system. With a smooth left-handed swing that one club official compared to Carlos Gonzalez's, Nunez focuses on using the center of the field. He has reasonable control of the strike zone for a youngster along with 15-homer upside, but he has struggled at the plate since leaving low Class A. He runs better than a typical catcher and will steal a base if the defense forgets about him."
"MLBPipeline.com's No. 2-ranked prospect for the 2016-17 international signing period, Morejon pitched for Cuba's 12-and-under team, 15-and-under team and 18-and-under team, and he was the MVP of the 15-and-under World Cup in Mexico in 2014. He left the island during the winter of 2015 and was declared a free agent by Major League Baseball on July 6. The following day, the Padres signed the then-17-year-old left-hander for $11 million, blowing well past the team's allotted spending pool and incurring a luxury tax penalty in the process. Morejon impresses with a combination of stuff and polish that belies his age. He's physically strong, with an athletic and repeatable delivery that gives him present command of a fastball that sits 91-93 mph and has reached 96. Morejon's curveball gives him a second plus pitch, and he's comfortable mixing in a knuckle-changeup as well as a standard changeup. He throws strikes with his entire arsenal, and he should continue to make gains in velocity and command as he matures physically.  Morejon's career is just beginning, but there are some evaluators who believe he could eventually be a No. 1 or No. 2 starter in the big leagues if he continues to develop at a normal pace. That process began in earnest in 2017, with the left-hander impressing during his professional debut at age 18 with Class A Short Season Tri-City."
"Garcia was already 20 when he signed with the Pirates in February 2013 and he didn't make his organizational debut until 2014 in the Dominican Summer League. Given his age, the Pirates pushed him aggressively with an assignment to the full-season South Atlantic League for his United States debut. The big right-hander started in the 'pen, then took off as a starter, finishing fourth in the Minors in ERA.  Garcia pitches largely off of his fastball and it's a big one, touching 98-99 mph during his stint in the SAL All-Star Game and sitting in the mid-90s. He'll both miss bats and generate ground-ball outs with it. He'll complement the heater with a hard slider. He has a changeup, but has exhibited a limited feel for it ths far. He doesn't have the cleanest delivery in the world, but nothing that raises major red flags and he's generally around the strike zone.  Because of his physicality, Garcia does have a chance to start and he continued to do so effectively in 2016. But his fastball-slider combination could get him to the big leagues quickly if the Pirates decide to go that route."
"Hess worked mostly as a reliever during his first two years at Tennessee Tech before sliding into the starting rotation as a junior in 2014. The right-hander took to the role immediately, and the Orioles made him their fifth-round pick in June. He continued to make strides in his first full season, overcoming a shaky start at Class A Advanced Frederick to dominate during the second half and earn a late promotion to Double-A Bowie. Hess went 7-1 with 1.80 ERA over his final 12 regular-season starts and then starred in the Eastern League playoffs, winning both of his starts and allowing one earned run in 14 innings. Unfortunately for Hess, he hasn't fared nearly as well this season in his return to Bowie.  Hess' feel for pitching steadily improved in 2015, and by the end of the season he was pounding the zone with his entire four-pitch mix. His over-the-top release point helps him achieve consistent downhill plane with his fastball, which sits in the low to mid-90s and touches 97. Both his slider and curveball took a step forward last year, though neither projects to be above average, and he can get caught between them at times. He also has a serviceable changeup that plays against left-handed hitters.  Questions remain about whether Hess could remain a starter given his high-effort delivery and lack of an out pitch. But the significant improvement of his secondary pitches last season helped his cause, and club officials believe he can develop into at least a No. 4 starter."
"The Giants have one of the best catchers in the big leagues in Posey and one of the top catching prospects in the Minors in Susac. Nevertheless, they couldn't resist the temptation to draft Garcia when he was available with the 52nd pick in the 2014 Draft. The Conference USA Player of the Year signed for $1.1 million. Garcia has a mature approach, employs a short stroke and uses the entire field. He makes consistent hard contact and could provide 15 homers per season once he adds some more strength. Garcia's offense stands out more than his defense, though he should be able to stay behind the plate. He has an average arm but still needs to polish his receiving and blocking skills. A top student, Garcia has the work ethic to make the necessary improvements."
"Kubitza starred at Texas State for three years before the Braves selected him in the third round of the 2011 Draft, making him the highest drafted position player in school history. He has a patient approach at the plate and understands the strike zone well. He is still susceptible to strikeouts, however, as his swing has a tendency to get long. Kubitza produces good power and looks to drive balls into the gaps. Kubitza has improved defensively since joining the professional ranks and is now solid at third base. He has a strong arm and good hands. Kubitza has rebounded this season at Class A Advanced Lynchburg, reclaiming his prospect status after a disappointing full-season debut in 2012."
"Ryan was viewed as a better position prospect than a pitcher as a high school senior, even though he could pump a mid-90s fastball. He passed on signing with the Indians as a 40th-round pick in 2014 and honored his commitment to North Carolina, where he struggled at the plate and made only one appearance on the mound before leaving the team in 2016. The Indians took Ryan in the 30th round that June, signing him for $100,000, then dealt him to the Mets a little more than a year later in exchange for Jay Bruce. He excelled at Class A Advanced St. Lucie early in the 2018 season, earning Florida State League All-Star honors along with a promotion to Double-A.  Ryan shows power stuff out of the bullpen. He'll sit at 95-96 mph and touch 98 with a riding fastball that he pairs with a low-to-mid-80s slider that has a high spin rate and earns above-average grades from scouts. He also has a changeup, but it's a distant third pitch that he seldom throws. After issuing 3.6 walks per nine in his first full season, Ryan made strides with both his control and command in 2018 while trimming his walk rate to 2.5. The gains Ryan made with his breaking ball and overall feel for pitching last season bode well for his chances of reaching the Major Leagues as a middle reliever capable of working multiple frames."
"Part of the Dodgers' record-setting $166.9 million spending on international signees in 2015-16, Rincon signed for $350,000 out of the Dominican Republic. He broke into pro ball by logging a 1.044 OPS with 13 homers in 52 games between two Rookie leagues in 2016, then struggled for most of the next two seasons in low Class A. He responded well to a promotion to high Class A at the end of 2018, posting a 1.246 OPS with 15 homers in 29 contests and helping Rancho Cucamonga win the California League title.  Most of Rincon's value derives from his power potential, a product of his considerable strength and the loft in his right-handed swing. He has natural pop to all fields and doesn't have to hunt home runs, and he was a force late last year once he did a better job of managing his plate discipline and his at-bats. Whether he can tone down his aggressiveness on a permanent basis remains to be seen.  Rincon is a well-below-average runner who doesn't offer much on the bases or the outfield corners. He has solid arm strength but he's an erratic defender with limited range. His power will have to carry him to the big leagues."
"In his brief time as a pro, Perkins has shown a knack for doing one thing very well: hit. And as most baseball people will tell you: If you can hit, you'll likely find a job in the big leagues. Perkins was raking in the Florida State League during his first full season in 2013 before a broken wrist forced him out for a month. He has a knack for making consistent hard contact, and with a 6-foot-5 frame, he should add strength, which should lead to some of his doubles clearing fences. Perkins' other tools won't jump out at you, but he has the skills to be a decent corner outfielder. Perkins has played some corner infield in the past, and he could get another look there, but it's his ability to swing the bat that will continue to propel him up the ladder."
"Both of lefty Jamie Moyer's kids were drafted as infielders. Older son Dillon is now trying to transition to the mound with the Dodgers, while younger son Hutton parlayed a solid junior season at Pepperdine to land in the seventh round of the 2015 Draft. A quick start in the Midwest League earned him a promotion in his first full year.  Moyer has shown some ability with the bat. He hit 14 homers in the West Coast Conference as a junior at Pepperdine and, with an aggressive approach at the plate, the switch-hitter exhibited extra-base pop in his brief pro career. He might need to refine his approach if he wants to use that power consistently and hit for a decent average as he moves up the ladder. An average runner, Moyer played mostly second base during his pro debut, but saw ample time at shortstop and third in 2016.  That might set Moyer up well for a career as a utility man, one who swings the bat well and can play three infield positions. Perhaps he has the ceiling of an offensive-minded second baseman, but super-subs like that can play a long time in the big leagues."
"The son of former big leaguer Dante Bichette, and brother of Yankee farmhand Dante Bichette Jr., Bo Bichette clearly has some serious baseball bloodlines. Though he didn't come off the board as early as his brother did back in 2011, when the Yankees took him 51st overall, Bo's impressive bat still got him drafted by Toronto in the second round (No. 66 overall), not to mention an above-slot singing bonus of $1,100,000.   Like the others in his family, Bo does things in an unconventional way, but he has had some success against good competition. Over the summer, Bichette showed the ability to square up quality pitching, and his raw power was on display when he won the Under Armour All-American Game Home Run Derby in Chicago. This spring, he was still hitting the long ball but also was getting tied up on mid-range fastballs inside. While he doesn't have the same exact leg kick setup as his father and brother, there are a lot of moving parts to his swing, which concerns some scouts. He does have more bat speed than his brother did coming out of high school. A below-average runner, Bichette may continue to see time at shortstop, but, in the long run, he's probably best suited defensively for second base, or perhaps even left field.  Bichette immediately rewarded the Blue Jays by raking during his pro debut in the Gulf Coast League. There will continue to be questions surrounding his unorthodox setup and swing mechanics, but he's well on his way to becoming a productive, offensive-minded player at the highest level."
"Kaprielian was viewed as one of the more advanced college hurlers in the 2015 Draft following an impressive career at UCLA that included a national championship (2013). The Yankees took Kaprielian 16th overall, making him the highest-drafted college pitcher in franchise history, and then signed him for $2.65 million. Unfortunately, injuries have subsequently derailed Kaprielian's development, as a strained flexor muscle in his forearm limited him to just three starts in is first full season, while Tommy John surgery the following spring wiped out his entire 2017 campaign. It will now be up to the A's to get Kaprielian back on track after they acquired him, Dustin Fowler and Jorge Mateo for Sonny Gray at the Trade Deadline.  After working at 88-92 mph in college with a fastball that stood out more for its sink and command than it did for velocity, Kaprielian saw his velocity jump to 93-96 mph while touching 99 upon entering pro ball. He possesses a deep secondary arsenal, including a curveball, slider and changeup that all grade as at least above-average pitches when they're on. Kaprielian controls and commands his pitches very well, doing a good job of delivering all of them from the same arm slot.  Considered more of a pitchability right-hander with a ceiling of a No. 3 starter when the Yankees drafted him, Kaprielian has shown frontline stuff when healthy. He's fallen well behind the development curve and will have his workload monitored carefully moving forward, but the overall ingredients are there for Kaprielian to still move quickly once he finally returns to the mound, likely in mid-2018."
"All Field has done anywhere he's played -- from Bishop Gorman High School in Nevada to the University of Arizona to his first year-plus of pro ball -- is hit and prove people wrong. He did just that in his first full season in 2014, playing across two levels and earning organizational Player of the Year honors. The numbers in 2015 weren't as impressive, though he still showed a surprising power-speed combination.  An undersized outfielder with plus makeup and work ethic, Field maximizes the tools he does have. He does have a good approach at the plate with decent bat speed and has shown surprising pop at the plate. He's an average runner, but his instincts allow that to play up on both sides of the ball.   The Rays have been pleased with how Field has looked in center, but he sees time in all three outfield spots. He profiles best as a fourth-outfielder type, but it's never a good idea to limit an overachiever like Field."
"Osich was a starter at Oregon State and threw a no-hitter to beat UCLA and Trevor Bauer in 2011. He has battled injuries throughout his career and underwent Tommy John surgery in 2010. His health issues scared teams again on the eve of the 2011 Draft when he was pulled from his start in the NCAA Tournament after one inning because of elbow and back discomfort. Osich has Major League stuff when he's healthy and could be a starter. His injury history, however, makes him a better fit in the bullpen, where his power arsenal makes him a potential high-impact reliever. Osich throws his fastball in the upper-90s and mixes it with a solid slider and changeup. He reached Double-A Richmond this year and is moving quickly toward San Francisco."
"Looking to add more experienced college arms to an already pitching-rich system, the A's doubled down on a pair of Florida hurlers early in the 2016 Draft, selecting A.J. Puk seventh overall and then nabbing Shore in the second round. Though Puk was considered the more ""famous"" of the duo, it was Shore who was the Gators' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career. As a junior, he was named SEC pitcher of the year after going 12-1 with a 2.31 ERA in 18 starts. Strong and durable, Shore is a strike-throwing machine with a potential three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, sitting at 88-92 mph with ground-ball-inducing sinking action, but it plays up because of his command. His best pitch is his well-above-average changeup, which he locates and sinks extremely well, and it aids his effectiveness against left-handed hitters. Shore's breaking ball has improved but remains inconsistent in terms of both shape and pace. When it's right, however, the pitch can be virtually unhittable and has the potential of being a third Major League average offering. Shore will always stand out more for his pitchability than stuff. A lack of an explosive fastball limits his ceiling, but there's certainly a lot to like in a proven college performer who should be quick to the big leagues, where he's likely to serve as an effective No. 4 starter capable of eating innings."
"When the Giants made Gonzalez a second-round pick last June, it meant he went two rounds earlier than his father Luis did in 1988 before becoming a five-time All-Star and a World Series hero. After passing on his commitment to Texas Christian to sign for a below-slot $950,000, he burst into pro ball with 14 hits in his first five games. He finished third in the Rookie-level Arizona League batting race at .339 and played better defense than expected. Though Gonzalez had some of the best right-handed raw power among high schoolers in the 2017 Draft, he just focused on making quality contact in his debut. He showed advanced pitch-recognition skills, controlled the strike zone and used an inside-out swing to drill line drives from gap to gap. As he gets stronger and turns on more pitches, he should start producing more home runs. While Gonzalez is a below-average runner with modest arm strength, he does have soft hands and San Francisco believes he can stay at third base if he improves his footwork and range. He has good instincts and the work ethic to get better. If he has to move, he still might produce enough offensively to profile at first base or in left field."
