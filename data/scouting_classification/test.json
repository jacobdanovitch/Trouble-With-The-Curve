He became the first player in program history to be chosen in the Draft when the Rays took him with the No. 32 overall pick that June, and he signed for slightly above slot at $2.3 million to forgo his Louisville commitment. Assigned to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League for his pro debut, Schnell homered in his first ever plate appearance but produced an overall line of .239\/.378\/.373 over 19 games.  Schnell has a sound left-handed swing and uses the entire field. Though he has mostly gap power right now, he has the solid bat speed and wiry strength to develop average power once he fills out his extremely projectable frame. He currently has above-average speed, bordering on plus, but many evaluators believe he'll lose a step as he gets stronger. Schnell also offers a well-rounded defensive package. He has the speed and instincts to stick in center field and arm strength -- he showed a fastball that reached the low-90s in high school -- that's suitable for right now. He has a higher ceiling in center, as a move to a corner spot would come with greater offensive demands.","label":0},{"name":"dean deetz","player_id":"657209","report":"Deetz hurt his elbow in summer ball before his high school senior season, had Tommy John surgery and redshirted for a year at Northeastern Oklahoma JC before returning to the mound in 2014. His fastball hit 98 mph that spring, prompting the Astros to draft him in the 11th round, and he bounced between the rotation and bullpen in his first four years as a pro. He drew an 80-game suspension in January 2018 after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance, excelled as a full-time reliever after his return and made his big league debut in September.  Deetz worked mostly as a tandem starter before he reached Triple-A, where he got hit hard taking a normal turn in a rotation. As a starter, he operated with a low-90s fastball that peaked at 95 mph and a low-80s slider with a big break. His stuff kicked up when he took a relief role, with his heater parking at 94-97 mph and reaching 99 mph while his slider sat in the mid-80s with sharper break. After struggling to develop a changeup, Deetz focused on his two main pitches once he shifted to the bullpen. While his fastball and slider can be overpowering in short stints, he still has yet to prove he can control and command them on a consistent basis. He has 59 walks in 79 Triple-A innings and will have to locate his pitches better to find a role in Houston.","label":1},{"name":"jaime schultz","player_id":"621289","report":"Drafted out of High Point University as a red-shirt junior who had Tommy John surgery, Schultz has shown a combination of intriguing stuff and subpar command in his brief pro career.

His fastball touches the mid-90s and features considerable arm-side run, and he combines it with a power breaking ball and a potentially average changeup. As good as his swing-and-miss stuff is, he struggles finding the strike zone, walking 5.6 batters per nine innings heading into 2016.\r\nWhile he does maintain his velocity into starts and doesn't have a ton of effort in his delivery, most feel Schultz will end up in the bullpen, where he could see an uptick in velocity and serve as an effective short reliever.","label":1},{"name":"jo adell","player_id":"666176","report":"From a raw tools perspective, there may not have been anyone more enticing in the 2017 Draft class than Adell.

While there was some concern about his ability to hit, the Angels liked the upside enough to take him No. 10 overall and sign him for full pick value. He then went out and showed off all of those tools across two levels of rookie ball during his pro debut, and kept on doing it across two levels of A ball in his first full season, earning a trip to the Futures Game in the process.\r\n\r\nWhile no one questions Adell's raw power and bat speed from the right side, some were concerned with his ability to make enough contact to tap into it due to some swing-and-miss tendencies that showed up against top competition on the summer showcase circuit. There were some strikeouts during his debut, but he impressed the Angels with his ability to make adjustments and drive the ball to all fields. A tremendous athlete with plus speed, Adell has the chance to continue to be a basestealing threat long term. It also helps give him plenty of range to patrol center, though he didn't play the outfield last summer because of a minor shoulder issue. His plus arm, which fired upper-90s fastballs from the mound in high school, would also work in right.\r\n\r\nEven with the exciting debut, patience will be key in the dynamic outfielder's development.

His fastball usually ranges from 88-91 mph and tops out at 93, and he also shows aptitude for employing his changeup. Because he doesn't have a lot of projection in his 6-foot-1 frame, Javier probably will have average fastball velocity at best. He'll need to challenge hitters more often at higher levels after his walk rate rose to a career-high 4.1 per nine innings in 2017.

However, his progress was slowed in 2017 by a shoulder injury that kept him out of action for a couple of months.\r\n \r\nLeyba excels with an innate ability to find the barrel of the bat, especially from the left side of the plate. He's a free swinger with tremendous hand-eye coordination, but one of the keys to his step forward last season was improved plate discipline and a better walk rate. That allowed him to increase his extra-base output, and he could eventually be a 10-12 home run kind of hitter. Leyba has played more shortstop than anywhere else since joining the organization and can make all the plays there. He's also shown the ability to play a more-than-capable second base.\r\n \r\nLeyba raised the bar a bit following his first full season in the organization but didn't get to replicate it because of injury in 2017.

Unfortunately for Hess, he hasn't fared nearly as well this season in his return to Bowie. \r\nHess' feel for pitching steadily improved in 2015, and by the end of the season he was pounding the zone with his entire four-pitch mix. His over-the-top release point helps him achieve consistent downhill plane with his fastball, which sits in the low to mid-90s and touches 97.

He also has good feel for a fading changeup that helps him keep lefties at bay.\r\nShawaryn's low three-quarters arm slot adds deception without compromising his ability to throw strikes. Some scouts point to his arm angle and the effort in his delivery and think he'll eventually have to move to the bullpen, while others believe his durability and ability to maintain his stuff will keep him in the rotation. To remain a starter, he'll need to improve his fastball command, learn to elevate some four-seamers and further refine his changeup.","label":0},{"name":"kody clemens","player_id":"665019","report":"Kody's brothers, Koby and Kacy, were former eighth-round picks. Another of Roger Clemens' sons, Kody was considered a better prospect than his older siblings and he proved it this spring. Fully healthy (he had Tommy John surgery and spent 2016 as a DH at Texas), Clemens was the Big 12 Conference Player of the Year and was a Golden Spikes Award finalist, finishing his junior campaign with a .351\/.444\/.726 line and 24 home runs in 65 games. The Tigers took him at the start of the third round that June, signed him for $600,000, then watched as Clemens hit his way up to Class A Advanced Lakeland during his pro debut.  Clemens stands out for his left-handed power as well as the gritty makeup that enables him to get the most out of his otherwise average tools and skills. He worked to get stronger and to turn on and pull more pitches, increasing his game power without sacrificing his ability to control the strike zone and grind out quality at-bats. The power output is new, as Clemens totaled just 10 home runs in his first two years at Texas before erupting as a junior, though scouts do believe he could be a .260 hitter who hits 20 homers annually when all is said and done.  A below-average runner, Clemens compensates for his lack of speed and fringy range at second base with tremendous instincts and smart positioning. He's a reliable defender at the keystone, with good hands and enough arm strength to make all the routine plays.","label":0},{"name":"samad taylor","player_id":"669392","report":"A 10th-round Draft pick by the Indians out of the California prep ranks in 2016, Taylor, who signed for $125,000, showed advanced hitting ability during his pro debut and continued to do so the following year in the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League, where he owned a .300\/.328\/.467 slash line when the Tribe dealt him and lefty Thomas Pannone to Toronto for reliever Joe Smith at the July Trade Deadline. Advancing to full-season ball in 2018, Taylor impressed his new organization with his blend of power and speed as he totaled 48 extra-base hits and 44 steals over 121 games in the Midwest League. Taylor's wiry frame is loaded with quick-twitch athleticism. It translates to good bat speed and better-than-expected power at the plate, with Taylor showing he can consistently impact the baseball. Those qualities, along with his feel for controlling the zone, give him a chance to be at least an average hitter, with power that should play in games more often as he becomes more physical and improves his pitch recognition and selectivity. A plus runner, Taylor's 44 steals in 2018 were good for a share of third place in the Midwest League, but he will need to improve his reads and jumps after he was thrown out 16 times, the second-highest total in the circuit.  Taylor's athleticism shows at second base, where he profiles as an average defender. He has good range, quick feet and above-average arm strength. There's first-division regular upside if it all clicks for Taylor, and he also has a fairly high floor with his blend of hitting ability, patience and speed at an up-the-middle position.","label":0},{"name":"eric fornataro","player_id":"543174","report":"Fornataro came out of Miami-Dade Junior College and was initially developed as a starter, a strike-throwing sinkerballer who reached the Class A Advanced Florida State League in 2011.

While Fornataro doesn't rack up strikeouts, he is up into the upper-90s as a reliever, with a ton of sink that has led to big groundout\/flyout ratios. His curve flashes plus at times as well and he throws strikes.

That he did so in Savannah, one of the worst hitting environments in the Minor Leagues, was even more impressive. Becerra showed some of his raw power in the first half, but he expanded his strike zone too much. To his credit, he adjusted, and his walk rate skyrocketed while his strikeout rate came down. Becerra has plus power potential, and his improved hittability could allow him to tap into it more consistently in the future. \r\nBecerra is an average runner with an arm a tick above average, with enough of each to play a capable right field.

He reached Double-A and finished second to Neidert among Miami farmhands in wins (10) and strikeouts (141 in 150 2\/3 innings) after changing organizations. Dugger has solid command of his two- and four-seam fastballs, with the former sitting in the low 90s with sink and the latter touching 96 mph. His slider gives him a solid second offering, while he's making progress with a changeup to combat left-handers. He'll also mix in a show-me curveball to give batters a different look. The athletic Dugger repeats his delivery well and throws strikes. The next step will be to refine his command to keep more advanced hitters off his effective but less than overwhelming stuff.

He tried switch-hitting during his pro debut but exclusively hit from his natural side in 2016 at the request of the Mariners. A line-drive hitter who uses the whole field, he has good instincts for his age as well as a quality approach. Meanwhile, scouts believe he'll show more power in games as he grows into his wiry strong frame. Hernandez's speed translates well in center field, where he profiles as a future plus defender with plenty of range and a plus arm.\r\nThough Hernandez likely will need time to refine his all-around game and come into his own as a player, he already shows the makings of becoming an everyday center fielder.

The Dodgers made his older brother Jordan, a right-hander, a supplemental first-round choice last June.\r\nSheffield pitches off a 92-94 mph fastball that can reach 96 with some run and sink. His go-to breaking ball is a power slider that usually arrives in the mid-80s, and he can vary its shape to come up with a low-80s curveball.

Because he's undersized at 5-foot-10, he has to stay on top of his pitches in order to generate much plane.

He turned the trick again during his United States debut in 2016 and again in his full-season debut a year ago when he was dealt to the Phillies in the Pat Neshek trade last July.  Gomez doesn't have loud tools, but he does have a very good feel to hit, with low strikeout rates, that has led to a .312 career average heading into the 2018 season, something he didn't continue to do in the Florida State League in 2018. He's continuing to work on adding strength, something he'll need so he can impact the baseball more consistently as he moves up the ladder. An average runner, Gomez is aggressive on the basepaths and likes to steal, though he gets caught too frequently. He's moved all over the infield for much of his career to date and while he played more shortstop than anywhere else the last two seasons, the Phillies plan to go back to having him play there, second and third.  Gomez is the kind of player who won't wow you the first time you see him, but over time you'll notice his feel for the game and his ability to do the little things.

It looked like they were starting to with a huge 2016 season in Double-A Reading's friendly ballpark, but while he still hit for power in the move to Triple-A in 2017, much of the rest of his offensive game went in the wrong direction. There are few players, if any, in the Minors with more raw power than the 6-foot-6 Cozens. He could easily miss-hit 20 homers a year at any level, in any ballpark. What got him into trouble in 2017 was that he was trying to hit 20 homers in a month which, in turn, led to a Minors-leading strikeout total. There will always be swing-and-miss to his game, but for him to have a chance, he'll have to get back to focusing on being a more complete hitter. Cozens runs better than you'd think given his size, has 20 or more steals in three seasons and has worked hard to become a solid corner outfielder.

On the other, he doesn't have eye-popping stuff, limiting his ceiling and leaving little margin for error. Allard's fastball comes in at 88-93 mph, grading out as fringy based only on velocity, but it plays up to average because he commands the pitch well. Both his changeup and curve can be above-average, but neither present themselves as true out pitches at the big league level. He's a good strike-thrower, but needs pinpoint command to have success in Atlanta. Allard is way ahead of the curve age-wise, providing hope he can figure things out. He knows he can't make a mistake over the plate and is very good to his arm side, but he needs to improve his glove side command. With a tendency to pitch away to right-handers, good hitters will sit on that, so an ability to pitch to all quadrants is essential.

He got hammered and had diminished velocity in his fourth, after which he learned that he needed elbow reconstruction that will sideline him throughout 2019. Before he got hurt, Kopech showcased some of the nastiest stuff in the Minor Leagues and earned comparisons to Noah Syndergaard. Hitters have great difficulty catching up to his fastball, which parks at 95-99 mph and often reaches triple digits with late running action. They're also overmatched by his mid- to upper-80s slider with two-plane break, a true wipeout offering at its best. Kopech also throws a sinking changeup that has its moments but can get too firm, and he has added a curveball to give him an offering with greater velocity separation from his fastball. He has battled his control for much of his pro career, especially when he rushes his delivery, though he seemed to turn a corner when he totaled four walks in his final seven Triple-A starts.

His fastball registers in the 98-100 mph range out of the bullpen, and his hard slider is a big-time swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup will never be fantastic, but he does use it against left-handed hitters on occasion. The biggest thing holding Rainey back is his command. He's walked 5.3 per nine in his career, and issued 12 walks over seven innings in eight outings with the Reds. He has closer stuff and the mentality to handle the job, but he'll need to find the strike zone a bit more consistently to get a chance to do it in the big leagues.","label":1},{"name":"marcos diplan","player_id":"650959","report":"The top-ranked pitcher on MLB Pipeline's Top 30 international prospects list for 2013, Diplan landed a $1.3 million bonus from the Rangers and dazzled during his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League. The Brewers acquired him during the offseason in the January 2015 trade involving Yovani Gallardo, and he was moving quickly through Minors, pitching well at each stop, before regressing in his return to Class A Advanced in 2017. While the results weren't all that much better for Diplan in 2018, he still managed to reach Double-A at age 21 \r\nAn undersized right-hander with a quick arm, Diplan will sit in the mid-90s when he's at his best, but his velocity tends to fluctuate from outing to outing, depending on how well he's repeating his delivery and whether he's staying on line to the plate. Those same mechanical issues also affect his slider, which can flush plus with devastating action but usually plays closer to average. His changeup has progressed enough that it's now viewed as his better secondary offering, receiving above-average grades from evaluators. Diplan has well-below-average control that has regressed with each season, and he posted the worst walk rate of his career (5.6 walks-per-nine) with a career-high walk total (74) in 2018. \r\nDespite his inconsistent performance during the regular season, Diplan finished on a high note by striking out 10 and issuing two walks over six one-hit innings to lead Biloxi into the Southern League Championship Series. While it was the type of performance that offers hope that Diplan might still develop into a mid-rotation starter, the growing consensus among evaluators is that the right-hander will end up in the bullpen.","label":0},{"name":"kelvin gutierrez","player_id":"642721","report":"A late bloomer, Gutierrez didn't sign out of the Dominican Republic until he was 18 and received a mere $30,000 bonus from the Nationals in April 2013. He has performed consistently in pro ball, played well in a brief stint in the Arizona Fall League last offseason and claimed a spot on Washington's 40-man roster in November. He headlined the prospect package the Nats sent to the Royals for Kelvin Herrera, going to Kansas City along with outfielder Blake Perkins and right-hander Yohanse Morel in June.\r\n\r\nThe Nationals viewed Gutierrez as one of the better pure hitters in their system. He has a relatively simple inside-out stroke from the right side of the plate that produces hard contact across the whole field and fuels his projection as an above-average hitter. And while he hasn't yet figured out how to apply his raw power during games, he should clear more fences once he becomes more comfortable firing his barrel and turning on the ball.\r\nPrimarily a shortstop early in his career before shifting to third base in 2014, Gutierrez moves well for his size at the hot corner. He has athletic actions, plenty of range and near plus-plus arm strength. After committing 25 errors in 2016, he was more focused and consistent last year, prompting many evaluators to peg him as a future above-average defender.","label":1},{"name":"lucius fox","player_id":"665650","report":"Fox projected as a likely second-round pick in the 2015 Draft in what would have been his senior year at American Heritage High (Delray Beach, Fla.), but his stock and his bank account soared after he moved back to his native Bahamas.

He struggled some making his pro debut in 2016 as a 19-year-old in low Class A, though that was somewhat expected given his age and his 18-month layoff from game action. At the Trade Deadline, the Giants shipped Fox, along with right-handed pitcher Michael Santos and big leaguer Matt Duffy, to the Rays in exchange for Matt Moore.\r\nThe best athlete in the 2015 international class, Fox has plus-plus speed and three more tools that should be at least solid. A switch-hitter with a line-drive stroke, he has the approach and the wheels to become a leadoff hitter and prolific basestealer. He won't be a homer threat but he does have some strength and can drive some balls to the gaps.\r\nFox's range, quick hands and arm fit easily at shortstop. Some scouts don't love his middle-infield actions and think he'll fit better in center field, though the Giants believed he could stay at short, lauding his ability to learn quickly.

He continued to climb the ladder in 2016, when received a mid-July promotion to Triple-A after earning Mid-Season All-Star honors in the Texas League.\r\nWith good strength to his sturdy frame and a lofty swing, Torres has intriguing power potential. It has yet to translate into much over-the-fence pop as a pro, though, with most of his well-struck balls instead going to the gaps. But some scouts still believe the power is still on the way, citing a lack of explosiveness with his lower half as a clear area for improvement. Regardless, Torres has a chance to reach the big leagues based on his pure hitting ability and use of the entire field. \r\nTorres has seen time at both corner outfield spots, but his below-average speed and average arm strength portend a career in left field.

The Mariners certainly agreed with that assessment, as they inked the 16-year-old outfielder for $1.75 million on July 2 and then began to acclimate him to the professional ranks with an assignment to the Dominican instructional league in the fall.  Rodriguez has a chance to be a special hitter, one who projects to hit for average and already shows robust raw power during batting practice. Rodriguez does have a pre-pitch waggle in the batter's box that can get his timing out of sync at times and results in some swing-and-miss, but his advanced approach at the plate and his overall bat speed helps solve some of the issues caused by his developing batting mechanics. Overall, he has the ability to drive the ball to all fields and he consistently makes hard contact. On the other side of the ball, Rodriguez shows the makings of an everyday right fielder because of his solid defensive skills and above-average arm strength. His offensive profile is a clean fit at the position, and scouts believe Rodriguez has the potential to be a middle-of-the-order type of run producer once fully developed.","label":0},{"name":"david paulino","player_id":"600944","report":"The Tigers signed Paulino out of the Dominican Republic for $75,000 in 2010 but he pitched just 39 innings in three years in their system before blowing out his elbow in 2013.

Paulino missed the entire 2014 season but the early returns were impressive from his comeback in 2015.\r\nPaulino was a skinny 16-year-old with a mid-80s fastball when he signed. Five years and 40 pounds later, he's dealing in the low 90s and reaching 95 mph. He also shows feel for spinning the ball and could have a solid curveball.\r\nPaulino has little mileage on his arm but has missed out on a lot of innings and experience.

Some adjustments he made to his swing in the last couple years have paid off, enabling him to make more consistent contact. He's an above-average runner and has begun to better incorporate his speed into his game. \r\nDefensively, Gonzalez has a plus arm and moves well laterally, giving him plenty of range to both sides.

Since passing on the opportunity to play wide receiver for the Blazers that fall, he has shown some of the best all-around tools in the Royals system. Hicklen offers plus raw power from the right side of the plate and well above-average speed. He's more raw at the plate than a typical 22-year-old college product, and he must prove he can make consistent contact against quality pitching. He has performed well at the lower levels of the Minors, however, and could be a 20-20 player if he figures things out as a hitter. Though his speed presently plays better on the bases than in the outfield, his quickness could make him a solid defender in center if he can improve his reads and routes.

That has led to good batting average and on-base numbers, as he topped .300 in two of his first three professional seasons. There has always been some question about how much power Smith will have, but he started showing more extra-base pop during his breakout campaign. Focusing on developing as a hitter first, he and the Mets have been confident more over-the-fence power will start showing up in time, and it started to do so in Double-A during the 2016 season.

Soto showed an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, from the get-go in his pro debut with the Braves in 2017. He rarely struck out and drew plenty of walks, but didn't have much to show for it production-wise because of a lack of strength. By the time he reached the Pioneer League with the Angels, he had gotten much more physical, and while he's never going to be a home run hitter, the added strength allowed him to impact the ball more consistently to the point where some feel he could be an above-average hitter if he continues to commit to that part of his development. While he played on both sides of second base in 2018, there's no question he can handle shortstop with a strong arm and terrific hands.

With the bat speed and leverage he generates from the right side of the plate, the ball jumps off his bat and he could produce 20 homers per season in his prime. He'll need to make more consistent contact to get the most out of his pop, and club officials believe he's intelligent enough to make those adjustments. All three of Curbelo's games in 2017 came at shortstop, though it's unlikely he'll stay there. He's an average runner who figures to lose a step as he gets stronger, making second base (where he spent most of his debut) the best-case scenario and third base another possibility.

Despite Bauer's promising hit tool, his ceiling will always be tied to his power. He made strides in that department in 2015 by hitting a career-best 11 home runs and 32 doubles, and he's on pace to surpass both of those totals this year in the Southern League.\r\nBauers boosted his prospect stock in the Fall League by showing the ability to play both corner outfield positions comfortably, in addition to his usual duties at first base. The improved defensive versatility could make his bat even more valuable, and he'll have nearly a full season's worth of Double-A games under his belt by the time he turns 21.","label":1},{"name":"will benson","player_id":"666181","report":"Benson endeared himself to scouts with his loud tools while playing for USA Baseball's gold medal-winning squad in the 18U World Cup in Japan.

Targeting offensive upside, the Indians selected Benson, a Duke commit, with the No. 14 overall pick in June, and then saved nearly $500,000 by signing him for $2.5 million. He struggled at times in the Rookie Arizona League during his pro debut but still showed the ability to impact games in a variety of ways, finishing second on the team in doubles (10), home runs (6), walks (22) and stolen bases (10).\r\nBenson's bat speed and strength give him well-above-average raw power from the left side of the plate, and he already shows the ability to get to it during games. He's at his best when he stays short to the ball and uses the whole field, and the Indians have worked to get him into a better position to hit. And while strikeouts may always be a part of his game, Benson impressed club officials during his pro debut with his ability and willingness to coax walks.\r\nBenson is a standout athlete with slightly above-average speed, although he's likely to lose a step or two as he fills out physically. It's also why Benson, a center fielder in high school, is best suited to play right field in pro ball, where he profiles as an average defender with a plus arm. Benson has the tools to develop into a middle-of-the-order hitter, but he may require extra time to refine his skills in the Minor Leagues.","label":0},{"name":"donnie walton","player_id":"622268","report":"A 36th-round pick of the Mets in 2012 out of high school, Walton chose not to sign and instead honored his commitment to Oklahoma State, where he would become a three-time All-Big 12 First Team selection.

He's a capable switch-hitter but does most of his damage from the left side, showing good bat speed and feel to hit as well as surprising power given his size. His average speed plays up on the basepaths due to his aforementioned instincts, and he's adept at reading pitchers and picking his spots to run. \r\nDefensively, Walton saw much of his time at shortstop early in his career, though scouts view him as a second baseman long term because he has below-average arm strength.

They've handled him carefully, limiting him to a total of 153 1\/3 innings in his first three seasons, though he still advanced to Class A at age 19. Marquez's fastball topped out at 95 mph in 2017 and sat at 93-96 and peaked at 99 last season with typical four-seamer riding action. His secondary pitches can vary wildly in consistency, with his breaking ball showing flashes of becoming a plus power curve but also devolving into a slurve when he doesn't stay on top of it. His changeup is less reliable, showing some life but often arriving too firm in the low 90s. Since coming to the United States in 2017, Marquez has had no problem throwing strikes. But his low-three-quarters arm slot and his mechanics lead some scouts to worry about his ability to master his secondary offerings and his command.

The injury bug bit Ramirez once more shortly after the trade, however, as he logged just one game at Double-A New Hampshire before suffering a season-ending knee injury. Though healthy in 2017, he's made little progress offensively in his return to the Eastern League. \r\n\r\nDespite missing significant time in each of the last three seasons, Ramirez continues to show good feel to hit, with a knack for making hard contact but with below-average power. Once considered a plus runner, Ramirez's speed is closer to above-average in the wake of his myriad leg injuries. With his days in center field behind him, Ramirez's future defensive home appears to be left field on account of his below-average arm strength.\r\n\r\nAn inability to stay healthy has hurt Ramirez's overall development, and scouts now peg him as more of a fourth outfielder rather than an everyday option.

He led White Sox farmhands with 21 homers between two Class A stops in 2017 and continued to swing a hot bat in the Arizona Fall League. Quite similar offensively and defensively to Evan Skoug, Chicago's 2017 seventh-rounder, Zavala has a higher floor but a lower ceiling. He tripled his home run output from his first full pro season to his second after changing his load to increase his launch angle. Most of his right-handed power comes to his pull side, and he'll have to do a better job of using the whole field and managing the strike zone to hit for average at higher levels.  Zavala projects more as an offensive-minded backup than a regular. He shows strong leadership skills, but his receiving and blocking are still works in progress.

It's that offensive upside that led the Brewers to take him in the second round of the 2016 Draft and then sign him for $1.15 million.\r\nThe left-handed hitter reminds some of a young Chase Utley in terms of body type. There is some pop in his bat as he reached double digits in home runs as a sophomore and had easily surpassed that with Menlo in 2016. At times, he's looked like a middle-of-the-order corner bat, while there are other instances where he hasn't been as consistent, and figuring out how his bat will play was more difficult while watching him against NAIA competition. \r\nErceg is athletic and should be able to stay at third, with a strong arm that fired 93-94 mph fastballs as Menlo's closer.

Somewhat surprisingly, Olson's production has regressed this season in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League, though he continues to get on base at a high clip. \r\nThough his numbers are down, Olson's raw power still ranks among the best in the Minor Leagues.

Olson strikes out quite a bit like any young slugger who sees a lot of pitches, but his strikeout rates have remained fairly consistent as he's moved up the ladder.\r\nThe A's experimented with Olson in right field at the end of the 2015, and he's once again seen a bulk of his playing time at the position this season.

He combines plus bat speed with a violent-but-controlled swing to produce tons of hard contact from line to line, and scouts like his chances of becoming a plus-or-better hitter with above-average power. He's an average runner with good range and instincts at shortstop, and the Blue Jays plan to keep him at the position for as long as they can. Some believe he's best suited for second or third base, or perhaps even left field, but so far he's passed every test at his natural position.\r\nMuch like his teammate and friend Vladimir Guerrero Jr., there seems to be no limit to Bichette's offensive ceiling.

The lefty reliever didn't rack up saves in his first full season, but he did pitch very effectively in the South Atlantic League, striking out 12.4 per nine innings and keeping hitters to a .198 batting average against. He does it with a solid two-pitch mix, really all he needs to succeed in short relief. His fastball sits in the low-90s and touches 95 mph, but it plays up because it has plus movement and comes from a low three-quarters arm slot. His sweeping slider gets swings and misses from hitters on both sides of the plate. He has less than pinpoint command, but throws enough strikes to be effective.

He's been clocked up to 95 mph and sits comfortably in the 91-92 mph range with heavy sink. His power 11-to-5 curveball has late bite and has the chance to be a plus offering. He has some feel for the changeup, though he had little need for it in high school. His delivery gets out of balance often and, as a result, his control lags well behind his stuff.\r\nWhen he's right, Franklin works on a downhill plane and will show the makings of a future mid-rotation starter.

The Pirates got him in the Competitive Balance Round B, but his pro debut ended with a hamstring injury in just his second Gulf Coast League game.\r\n\r\nWhen healthy, Uselton's bat speed, strength and leverage give him some serious raw power. He struggled a bit last summer on the showcase circuit, as an arm bar in his right-handed swing contributed to him getting out of sync. He was able to refine his mechanics during his senior season though, and was more consistent as a result, using the entire field and quieting concerns about his ability to hit enough to tap into that power.\r\n\r\nUselton runs well, though he could lose a half-step as he fills out.

He can impart cutting action on the pitch, and his velocity plays up because he hides the ball well. Voth's slider and changeup give him a pair of Major League-caliber secondary offerings, and club officials were particularly impressed with his development of the latter in last year's Arizona Fall League.\r\nPitching with above-average control and command has long been one of Voth's strength. He's shied away from attacking hitters in the strike zone in 2017, though, spending much of the season nibbling at the corners so as to avoid yielding hard contact.

He wasn't even able to start his pro career in earnest until 2017 because of a back injury. The Angels didn't want to get too excited about his debut in the Pioneer League that summer, but it was hard not to be encouraged by his 2018 that saw him play across both levels of A ball.  While Marsh had a very productive first taste of full-season ball, what makes him an even more intriguing prospect is that he still has a lot to learn, especially at the plate. He does have a good feel to hit and showed he's more than willing to draw walks, but there is a lot of swing and miss there and he does need to work on the consistency of his swing. Once he does that, he should be able to hit for average and power. His speed works on both sides of the ball, and he showed the ability to steal a base and run down everything in center field.   Marsh showed he can be a plus defender at all three outfield positions, and his plus arm certainly would play in right.

It was more of the same for Honeywell during the first half of 2016, when he parlayed another strong showing with Charlotte into a mid-season promotion to Double-A.\r\nHoneywell is a good athlete who repeats his quick and effortless delivery with ease. His velocity has steadily increased over the past few years to the point where he now operates in the low 90s and can reach back for a few more ticks as needed, and scouts believe he could add even more velocity as he grows into his lean and athletic frame. Honeywell's outstanding screwball represents his best secondary offering and is anything but a novelty, as he's adept at using his advanced arsenal to set up the pitch. He also mixes in an above-average changeup and serviceable curveball. \r\nHoneywell is a fierce competitor who attacks the zone better than most pitchers his age, and his athleticism and smooth mechanics suggest his command should continue to improve.

The Rays still made McCarthy their fifth-round pick that June, and he rewarded the organization with a breakout full-season debut, highlighted by a successful second-half showing at Class A Advanced Charlotte that earned him an Opening Day assignment to Double-A in 2017.\r\nMcCarthy is a pure hitter who controls the strike zone well and excels at getting on base, with the strength and leverage to produce above-average left-handed power. He got to it more often last season by incorporating better lower-half strength into his swing and turning on more pitches, something he struggled doing when he first returned from injury. McCarthy moves well for his size and applies his above-average speed on the bases and in the outfield. The only below-average tool in his arsenal is his arm, which relegates him to left field, though he did increase his defensive versatility last season through increased work at first base.\r\nMcCarthy gets the most out of his tools, and it's those intangibles that have the Rays believing McCarthy at least should serve as a fourth outfielder or bench bat in the big leagues.

He slumped as a junior at Arizona, however, making a greater impact on the mound as the Wildcats placed second at the College World Series. He looked like a steal after signing for an above-slot $650,000 as a fourth-rounder, batting .386\/.427\/.674 at short-season Lowell, but an old hamate injury sidelined him and contributed to a slow start in 2017.\r\nDalbec offers massive power potential, generating it with prodigious strength, bat speed and loft in his right-handed stroke and an aggressive approach. After trying to do too much at the plate with Arizona, he maintained a consistent routine in his debut, doing a better job of using the middle of the field and letting pitches travel deep. If he continues to let his power come naturally, he could hit for a decent average and produce 30 homers per year.\r\nWhile Dalbec lacks speed, he improved his range at third base in 2016 and most scouts think he'll be able to stay at the hot corner. There's no question that he has the arm for the position after he maintained a low-90s fastball and an effective slider while opening his junior season as the Wildcats' closer and finishing it as their top starter.

The Brewers made Ashby their fourth-round pick in June, signed him for slightly above slot value and then watched him carve up hitters while reaching Class A Wisconsin, where he posted double-digit strikeouts in two of his seven starts. Ashby's curveball is nasty, a true plus pitch that he can also manipulate to have harder, slider-like action. He opened his sophomore season throwing in the upper 80s but now sits 91-94 mph and can touch 96. His changeup is a distant third pitch, and there's been some thought within the organization about having him a throw a splitter instead. Ashby works from the third-base side of the mound and has an athletic but funky delivery that masks everything he throws with deception. Ashby's delivery also can hamper his ability to throw strikes at times, and the Brewers hope to smoothen it out without costing him any of his natural deception.

Guzman was on the move again the following offseason, this time going to the Marlins with Jose Devers and Starlin Castro in the Giancarlo Stanton blockbuster.\r\nGuzman's lightning-quick arm and relatively easy delivery produces exceptional velocity in a fastball that sits 97-103 mph as a starter. He showed better control of the pitch in 2017 after improving his mechanics, but regressed as a strike-thrower in '18 while pitching in the Florida State League. Guzman's power slider is an above-average pitch and complements his heater nicely, and together they help him to rack up strikeouts.

He reached Double-A for the first time in July, only to then be dealt to the Blue Jays later in the month with Ken Giles and David Paulino in exchange for Robert Osuna.  Perez can blow his fastball by hitters, ranging from 93-99 mph with two-seamers with nice sink and four-seamers with explosive riding life. He also can produce wipeout breaking stuff when he's on, though there are times when he can't find the strike zone with his slider or curveball. He uses a splitter as a changeup, and it likewise can elicit swings and misses or avoid the plate. Opponents struggle to make solid contact against Perez, who has four pitches that can grade as plus or better but lose effectiveness when he can't tame them. He's athletic enough to figure out control and command, but his delivery has timing issues that have prevented him from throwing consistent strikes.

He battled oblique and lat strains during his first two full seasons before going to the Tigers this September as the player to be named in a trade for Mike Fiers.\r\n\r\nShore has long stood out for his ability to command his three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, sitting in the low 90s with late sinking action that nets him many ground balls. His best pitch continues to be a plus changeup that he locates and sinks extremely well, in turn giving him a chance against left-handed hitters. Shore's breaking ball has improved but remains inconsistent in terms of both shape and pace, and it's clear that he'll need to clean it up even more after Cal League righties tagged him for a .303 average in 2017.\r\n\r\nShore will always stand out more for his pitchability than stuff, thus giving him a higher floor than ceiling. He has the potential to develop into an effective No. 4 starter capable of eating innings, but he'll first need to develop a better breaking ball and improve his durability in the wake of an injury-plagued '17 season during which he tossed five or more inning just five times in 17 starts.","label":0},{"name":"jose israel garcia","player_id":"676480","report":"The Reds were thrilled to be able to sign Garcia, an exciting infielder from Cuba, for close to $5 million at the end of the 2016-17 signing period. Then they had to wait 10 months to see him play in real competition, after he hadn't played for quite some time after defecting, challenging him with an assignment to full-season ball. After stumbling out of the gate, fans got to see what the fuss was all about in the second half of 2018.   Despite some concerns of pushing him too hard, Garcia was skipped over rookie ball and sent straight to the Midwest League with Dayton. The Reds were glad that they did. After he struggled at the plate the first three months, Garcia started to figure it out in the second half, hitting for average and showing some power, with five of his six homers for the season. He has shown a balanced set-up at the plate and the ability to send line drives to all fields, though he'll have to continue to refine his overall approach. He did deal with a left shoulder injury as well, but it was not too serious.  Garcia's plus speed and athleticism allows him to have very good range, and he has more than enough arm for the position. He largely played second base for the Cuban junior national team but played a majority of his games at shortstop for Dayton and the reviews have been good. The organization feels he has the makings of a solid Major League shortstop, with a caveat. If he continues to grow into his 6-foot-2 frame, he could outgrow the position and need to be moved.","label":0},{"name":"yennsy diaz","player_id":"660546","report":"The Blue Jays landed Diaz at the outset of the 2014-15 international period, signing him one day after they had inked current top prospect Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The right-hander pitched well in his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League to earn a promotion to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in late July, and he continued to make progress in the Appalachian League last season before wearing down physically late in the year.\r\nThough he's an undersized right-hander, Diaz's athleticism and fast arm generate a fastball that can reach 95-96 mph, though he typically operates in the low 90s. His heater has better movement -- sinking action, in particular -- in that range, though at times it does linger up in the zone. Diaz's secondaries lag well behind his fastball, but he does have some feel for a breaking ball, and will flash an average changeup.\r\nDiaz's walk rate jumped last season because he struggled to locate his heater, and it also made him vulnerable to the home run ball. His athletic frame and clean, repeatable delivery portends improvement in that regard, and club officials believe he's poised to take a step forward in 2017.","label":0},{"name":"michael hermosillo","player_id":"641684","report":"The Angels took a flier on Hermosillo, an athletic two-sport high school standout, giving him $100,000 to sign as a 28th-round pick in 2013. It's taken a while, but he really started to repay their faith and patience in him in '16, with an .869 OPS across two levels of A ball. He played at three levels in '17, got added to the 40-man roster that offseason and made his big league debut in 2018. Hermosillo continues to be a professional hitter, one who can hit for average and get on base. He can drive the ball to all fields and showed more over-the-fence power in Triple-A in 2018 with a career-high 12 homers, mostly to his pull side. His strikeout rate went up as a result, but he still draws enough walks to help offset it. Hermosillo's speed works on both sides of the ball -- he led the system with 35 steals in 2017 -- and it gives him the range to cover plenty of ground in all three outfield spots. A sports hernia that slowed him late in 2018 eventually needed offseason surgery, but isn't expected to be a long-range concern. He fits the valuable fourth outfielder profile perfectly and is ready to assume that role in the big leagues if he's healthy.","label":1},{"name":"kyle crick","player_id":"605195","report":"Crick might be the most confounding pitching prospect in baseball.

His second-best pitch is a slider\/cutter that's more notable for its upper-80s velocity than its bite. His curveball has good depth at times and his changeup has some sink and deception.\r\nWhen each of his pitches are at their best, Crick has a plus-plus fastball and three solid-or-better secondary offerings. His delivery tends to get out of whack, so he has trouble throwing strikes and putting his pitches where he wants when he does find the zone.

The ball comes out of his hands really well, with an easy delivery that brings plus fastballs to the plate in a hurry. Garcia's fastball has touched 100 mph and sits in the mid-90s with late life. He combines it with a slider that has the chance to be at least Major League average. Garcia has some command issues, not surprising given the limited time he's been on the mound, but has the mechanics to improve on that front over time. \r\n\r\nGarcia has the kind of stuff that could work very well in a closing role one day, perhaps following the Joakim Soria professional path.

Perez started out as a shortstop, and can still fill in there if needed, though he fits much better at second and should be an above-average defender there. He has the chance to hit for average, a line-drive hitter who makes a lot of contact and has a little extra-base pop as well.

He is a very patient hitter, and he doesn't strike out much. Cecchini's frame portends him eventually developing solid power, but it isn't a big part of his game yet. He is an average runner, but his impressive instincts allow that speed to play up on the basepaths.\r\nCecchini is a capable third baseman and has a strong arm.

He can miss bats both with that and his breaking ball, a plus pitch that combines curveball depth with slider velocity, although his changeup continues to be a work in progress. Holmes' control has regressed as he's climbed the ladder, but he's also been a consistently young hurler in every league. \r\nHolmes has the raw stuff to become a mid-rotation option, but he'll need time to refine his delivery, develop a more consistent change and improve his command.

The Twins were ready again, this time getting their man at No. 35 overall and signing him for full pick value. After a huge pro debut in the summer of 2017, Rooker was pushed to Double-A for his first full season, where he hit for power, but saw other parts of his offensive game regress. There is no question that Rooker's best position is batter's box. He's looking more like a power-over-hit type of offensive player, one with legitimate raw pop. He's always had swing and miss to his game, and his strikeout rate spiked with the aggressive move to Double-A. It's offset somewhat by his ability to draw walks and there's some hope that at his peak, he'll be a bit more well-rounded as a hitter than he was in 2018. He should be a good enough hitter for that power to play at any level. The big question surrounding Rooker is where he might play defensively. He saw time at first and left field in 2018, and the plan is to give him a consistent time split at both.

He had only sporadic success in his first two-plus pro seasons before finishing 2015 on a second-half tear, but he's struggling worse than ever in high Class A this year.\r\nBeras earned his hefty bonus primarily because of his massive right-handed raw power, which he creates with bat speed and the leverage in his 6-foot-6 frame.

He made a bid for the Rockies' starting catching job last September, homering five times in 44 at-bats and throwing out four of 10 basestealers, but a fractured forearm in Spring Training this year derailed those plans.\r\nMurphy is built to hit for power because he's strong and has a quick right-handed swing with loft.

Thomas is more polished than the average high school pick and could move relatively quickly through the Minors now that he's focused on baseball.

He has continued to rake in 2017, earning a promotion to Double-A by the end of May.\r\nSome scouts considered him the top hitter in the 2015 prep class, and he has done nothing to dispel that notion. A product of the same Plant High (Tampa, Fla.) program that spawned Hall of Famer Wade Boggs, Tucker has a smooth left-handed swing, quick hands, advanced pitch recognition and a patient approach. He has good leverage in his swing and likes to pull the ball, so he should grow into at least 20-homer power as he gets stronger.\r\nA more well-rounded player than his brother, Tucker has spent most of his first two years as a pro in center field. He'll probably lose a step and become more of an average runner once he fills out, but he should fit nicely in right field with his solid arm and instincts.

He entered last year as the best mound prospect in the upper levels of the system, but returning nearby where he grew up to pitch for Double-A Tennessee proved to be too much of a distraction. He got hammered to the tune of a 7.99 ERA during the final three months, earning a mandate from club officials to get stronger mentally and physically. During his breakout 2016 season, Clifton operated with a 91-94 mph fastball that touched 97, flashed a plus curveball and improved his changeup. Last year, he lost weight and his stuff regressed, with his fastball dropping into the upper 80s and his curveball deserting him. He has regained his velocity in 2018, when he also has shown a more reliable curve and had some success with his cutter and changeup. Control and command never were Clifton's strong suits and they also regressed in 2017 before bouncing back this year. He has toned down his delivery since entering pro ball but it still some features some effort, so there long have been questions whether he'd be better suited for relief work.

A finesse right-hander who has climbed steadily through the system, he led Houston farmhands in ERA (2.04) and strikeouts (146) in 2017 and went a combined 16-2 in Triple-A in 2017-18. He continued to perform well in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason yet may face a third season in Triple-A. While Armenteros only has one pitch that grades better than average, he has thrived because his tumbling changeup and his feel for sequencing and locating his entire repertoire keeps hitters off balance. He changes eye levels with sinking 88-90 mph two-seam fastballs and riding 90-92 mph four-seamers, and he has hit 95 mph at times. His average slider\/cutter and fringy curveball rarely buckle knees but he utilizes them well off each other. Armenteros falls off the mound toward first base in his delivery, though that provides deception without compromising his ability to throw strikes. He has little margin for error and survives by not making many mistakes.

After playing sparingly as a freshman, Diechmann erupted to hit 11 home runs the next year, then he blew past that total with 19 homers as a junior before going to the A's in the second round. After signing for $1.7 million, Deichmann showcased his impressive power by hitting eight homers in 46 games as Class A Short Season Vermont's everyday right fielder. Assigned to the California League for his first full season, Deichmann logged just 10 games before a wrist injury landed him on the disabled list for nearly three months.\r\n\r\nDeichmann's power is his calling card. The big left-handed hitter has impressed scouts with his bat speed and strength dating back to his high school days, and he's shown that he can get to it consistently in the past year-plus after shortening his swing and adopting a more selective approach. Deichmann's improved approach also has helped him in using the entire field, though much of his power remains to his pull side. And while strikeouts will always be a part of Deichmann's game given his power-over-hit profile, he does offset some of those concerns with perennially strong walk rates and on-base skills.\r\n\r\nA shortstop in high school, Deichmann saw time at first base at LSU before finding a home in right field, where his above-average arm and power profile are clean fits.

He excelled as one of the youngest starters (age 18) in the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League this summer, needing just five outings to earn a promotion to low Class A. Contreras' fastball velocity has increased from 89-93 mph when he turned pro to 93-97 mph this season. He has good feel for spinning a curveball that has power and depth and shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch. His changeup featues some fade and is coming along nicely as well.

Though he lacks polish, he reached Double-A and led New York farmhands in strikeout rate (10.7 per nine innings) in 2018. Nelson misses bats and generates groundouts with his power repertoire, which starts with a 94-98 mph four-seam fastball that he can maintain into the late innings. His hard curveball often works as a second plus pitch though there are times when he can't land it for strikes. He also has a low-90s splitter and an upper-80s slider\/cutter that have their moments but similarly lack consistency. Though Nelson is strong and athletic, he's still figuring out how to repeat his delivery and command his pitches. He's tough to hit but gives up too many walks, and more advanced hitters may not chase his secondary offerings out of the strike zone.

Bae was initially a second baseman as an amateur, but as he's grown and developed, he moved over to short, and the Pirates believe he has the tools, actions and arm to stay there long-term. He has shown the ability to make consistent contact at the plate, using all fields, and has surprised a bit with his ability to drive the ball, something that will improve as he physically matures.\r\nBae obviously has a long way to go and will take his first step as a professional this summer.

However, injuries have since derailed Harvey's progress, limiting the right-hander to just 63 2\/3 total innings since 2015. Elbow issues cost him part of 2014 and all of '15 before he ultimately required Tommy John surgery in June '16. When he returned to the mound in July 2017, Harvey looked like his old self while making eight starts across three levels, and the Orioles added him to their 40-man roster after the season. And while an impressive showing in Spring Training offered hope that 2018 might be the year Harvey stayed healthy and puts it all together, he made just eight starts at Double-A Bowie before a sore shoulder landed him on the disabled list in June, effectively ending his season.  Harvey continues to show dynamic stuff in the rare instances he's healthy. His fastball will sit in the 92-95 mph range and reaches 96-97, thrown with good angle from a relatively smooth delivery. He pairs his heater with a plus curveball that he throws with tight spin and considerable depth to create late downward action. Harvey's changeup gives him another quality offering, though his time on the shelf has impacted its development. Harvey has No. 3-starter upside based on his raw stuff, though it will be difficult for him to reach his ceiling (or anything close to it) if he can't stay on the field.

He spent most of his first two pro years holding his own as one of the youngest regulars in the high Class A California League, then batted .333\/.390\/.491 in Double-A during the final month of the 2017 season. Returning to Double-A in 2018, Diaz made across-the-board improvements at the plate during the first half and then showcased his abilities to a national audience by hitting a pair of impressive home runs in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game. His progress caught the attention of the Orioles, who acquired Diaz along with four other prospects in a 5-for-1 deal for Manny Machado at the All-Star break.  Diaz shows the potential for solid tools across the board with the exception of his power, although he has begun to show more pop after toning down his setup and incorporating his lower half more in his right-handed swing. He makes consistent barreled contact, driving the ball with authority to all fields, with enough bat speed and strength to provide 12-15 per season. Diaz could very well surpass those power projections, especially after he tightened his approach and drastically reduced his chase rate during his return to the Texas League.  Diaz has above-average speed but has yet to show much prowess as a basestealer. He spent most of his pro debut in center field, where he projected as an average defender.

Signed for $559,600 as a third-round pick, he could be the first 2018 draftee to reach the big leagues. Feltman's velocity increased during his freshman season, and he now works with a 95-97 mph fastball that peaks at 99 and features some running action. His power slider can be a wipeout pitch at times, arriving in the mid-80s with some depth. He also has a decent changeup that he can use to keep hitters off balance. Though he has three pitches, Feltman is strictly a reliever because he lacks size and has effort to his delivery. He's wiry, strong and durable, and he has improved his ability to locate his pitches.

Toffey controls the strike zone very well and shows power potential in his left-handed swing. He improved his walk and strikeout rates each year at Vandy and hit for more power than ever in 2017. While he hasn't shown that pop as a pro, he has been an on-base machine. Though he's a fringy runner, Toffey provides quality defense and solid arm strength at third base.

Neuse posted a .380 average in 40 games while reaching Double-A after joining the A's system, and then he continued to elevate his stock in the Arizona Fall League, where he finished in the top three in the circuit in RBIs, doubles, extra-base hits, runs scored, total bases, slugging and home runs. \r\n\r\nNeuse's right-handed swing is short and simple, but he also keeps his barrel in the hitting zone for an extended period of time and drives the ball across the whole field. He has above-average raw power and already knows how to get to it in games, a notion supported by his 16 home runs and 26 doubles across three levels in 2017. Some scouts still question how it will translate at higher levels because his game does have some swing-and-miss tendencies, albeit with sound overall plate discipline.\r\n\r\nNeuse is a fringe-average runner who shows good instincts on the bases and in the field. A shortstop in college, Neuse saw time there as well as third base prior to being dealt, but he handled the hot corner exclusively after joining the A's.

The Rays liked him more as a hitter and selected him with the 13th overall pick, then lured him away from a Florida State commitment with a $2.6 million bonus. He overcame a sluggish start in his full-season debut the next year and ultimately finished on a high note, hitting .296\/.350\/.415 with 24 extra-base hits and 14 steals over his final 72 games. The performance led to high expectations for Lowe's 2018 campaign, though he was unable to build upon that progress in the Florida State League, where his feel to hit backed up and resulted in below-average production.  Lowe's athleticism and physical tools suggest he'll eventually make an impact at the plate, but right now he's still figuring out what type of hitter he is. He knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone and has added some loft since signing, though, so far, it hasn't yet translated to any uptick in usable power. But even as he's scuffled at the plate, Lowe has worked to improve his approach and become more selective. That progress was evident in 2018, as he trimmed his strikeout rate by nearly 3 percent from the previous year while simultaneously improving his walk rate from 8.3 to 10.3 percent. It gives him a solid foundation for further offensive development, and club officials are still bullish about Lowe's potential to hit for average and power.  After struggling at third base during his pro debut, Lowe was shifted to center field and immediately proved a natural, covering huge amounts of ground with his plus speed and long, graceful strides. He's developed into the best defensive outfielder in the system and looks like a lock to stick in center field, where his offensive profile offers the most value.","label":0},{"name":"reese mcguire","player_id":"624512","report":"The Pirates used both of their first-round picks on up-the-middle preps in 2013, selecting Austin Meadows with the ninth-overall pick and then nabbing McGuire at No. 14, targeting the Washington state product for his revered defensive prowess.

Sidelined with a knee injury for much of the first half in 2017, McGuire performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July before making up for lost time in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason. \r\nMcGuire's defense has long been his calling card, and there's little doubt that it will get him to the big leagues. An excellent blocker and receiver who receives high praise both for his ability to handle a staff, McGuire also is adept at controlling the running game with his plus arm and efficient pop technique. At the plate, McGuire continues to show natural hitting ability with an advanced feel for the zone, though his power has been virtually non-existent as a professional.\r\nMcGuire's offensive profile may leave much to be desired, but the glove is good enough for him to carve out a role as defensive-minded backup in the big leagues.","label":1},{"name":"carl edwards jr.","player_id":"605218","report":"Chris Kemp recruited the mostly anonymous Edwards when he was an assistant coach at Spartanburg Methodist (S.C.)

He missed most of the 2014 season with a strained right shoulder that Chicago decided to handle cautiously but looked at full strength in the Arizona Fall League. \r\nEdwards usually operates in the low 90s with his fastball and has reached 97 mph, but the velocity doesn't matter as much as its natural cutting life.

He spent the offseason reworking his swing and approach, and it paid immediate dividends in his first full season as he paced the Class A Midwest League in most offensive categories before moving up to high Class A Dunedin in late May. Although his production slowed a bit in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League, Smith still put together a monster season, finishing with a .302\/.358\/.528 line, 25 home runs, 31 doubles and 29 steals in 129 games.  Smith's offseason adjustments were centered on him eliminating a hole in his swing, and he showed a shorter, more leveraged path to the ball in 2018, with improved feel for keeping his barrel in the zone and driving the ball to all fields. Smith's plus raw power from the right side of the plate is for real, and he hits some of his most impressive home runs to the opposite field. Smith does have some swing-and-miss to his game, but it's a fair trade off given his ability to hit for both average and power. Smith's speed is only average, but he gets the most out of it on the basepaths, wisely picking his spots to steal and consistently getting good jumps. Smith's offensive profile is only enhanced by his abilities at shortstop, where he's an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and plus arm strength. His defensive profile also fits well at third base, and Smith appeared in 27 games at the hot corner in 2018 on top of his usual reps up the middle.

He chose not to accept the reduced bonus, becoming just the third No. 1 pick in Draft history not to sign, and enlisted to pitch for IMG Academy's (Bradenton, Fla.) post-graduate program in 2015. Unfortunately, Houston's concerns about Aiken's elbow were validated when he left his first outing with IMG after just 13 pitches and underwent Tommy John surgery days later. The Indians were happy to gamble on Aiken's upside in the Draft, selecting him 17th overall and then signing him for $2,513,280.\r\nDuring his storied amateur career, Aiken showed command of three legitimate plus pitches. The left-hander spots his fastball to both sides of the plate, working at 92-94 mph and touching 97 with late life, and he can throw his curveball for a strike or take it out of the zone to induce whiffs. Aiken's changeup gives him a third weapon, thrown with good deception and tumble, and his athleticism and smooth, repeatable delivery bode well for his command profile.\r\nAfter beginning 2016 in extended spring training, Aiken made his long awaited pro debut in late June for the Indians' Arizona League affiliate. If he can regain and then build on his pre-surgery form, Aiken could develop into a front-of-the-rotation starter.","label":0},{"name":"drew strotman","player_id":"675977","report":"Despite pitching to mixed results during his three years at St. Mary's, Strotman shot up teams' Draft boards in the spring of 2017 following a move from the bullpen to the rotation. Targeting his upside in the latter role, the Rays selected him in the fourth round in June and signed him for $367,500. The right-hander's pro debut only validated Tampa Bay's scouting efforts, as Strotman posted a 1.79 ERA and a 0.75 WHIP while holding hitters to a .168 average over 51 innings in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. Advancing to Class A Bowling Green in 2018, Strotman got off to a strong start in the Midwest League before undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery in June. \r\nStrotman combines size and athleticism with a lightning-quick arm to generate a plus fastball that bumps 97-98 mph and sits at 93-95. His slider can be inconsistent but has the makings of at least an above-average pitch, while further strides in developing his changeup could give Strotman a third Major League-average offering at maturity. Meanwhile, Strotman's three-pitch mix plays up thanks to his advanced control and command and because he's adept at pitching down in the zone. \r\nMany expect Strotman, with his electric arm and promising arsenal, to serve as a valuable bullpen piece once he's fully developed. The Rays, however, will continue to deploy him as a starter, with the goal of offering him as many innings as possible so as to further his development.","label":0},{"name":"brandon jacobs","player_id":"571806","report":"The Red Sox went over slot to sign Jacobs away from a football scholarship at Auburn and they likely knew it would take some time to put his considerable raw tools to consistent use on the baseball field.

He was traded again in December, when the White Sox sent him to the D-backs as a part of the three-way deal that brought Adam Eaton to Chicago. Jacobs' plate discipline has been an issue, in terms of him controlling the strike zone and becoming more efficient, but he has extra-base pop and the ability to steal bases.

That progress endeared Rodriguez to the Orioles, who selected the right-hander with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2018 Draft. After signing for $4.3 million and forgoing a Texas A&M commitment, Rodriguez made his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in early July.\r\nRodriguez's fastball sits at 92-94 mph with heavy life and should turn wood bats into kindling. He has an array of promising secondary pitches, with most scouts preferring his low-80s slider to his mid-70s curveball, though the latter has nice shape. He didn't have much of need for a changeup as a high schooler but shows the potential to have an average one.\r\nWith his 6-foot-5 frame and high-three-quarters slot, Rodriguez creates steep downhill plane with his pitches and already shows a propensity for getting ground balls. He's a decent athlete who uses a controlled delivery that enables him to flood the zone with quality strikes. Those qualities could help Rodriguez move faster than the typical high school hurler, especially if he can make progress with his changeup and curveball.","label":0},{"name":"livan soto","player_id":"670869","report":"Soto was part of the Braves' 2016-17 signing period international haul, signing right on July 2 along with top international prospect Kevin Maitan, earning a $1 million bonus in the process.

The Angels signed both Maitan and Soto once the window opened for them to do, giving Soto $850,000 to join the organization.\r\nSoto's carrying tools are on defense. With a live and lean athletic body, the middle infielder has outstanding instincts at short, with soft and steady hands and more than enough arm to stay at the premium position long-term.

Beer has impressive strength and plate discipline, which translated into monster numbers in three college seasons: .321\/.489\/.648 with 56 homers and nearly twice as many walks (180) as strikeouts (98) in 188 games. Scouts who believe in him think that he can be an on-base machine whose left-handed power can carry him to stardom. Others don't love his less-than-smooth swing and point to his wood-bat history, which includes struggles on the high school showcase circuit and a .208\/.344\/.287 line in two summers with the U.S. collegiate national team. Beer has to produce at the plate because he offers little as a runner or defender.

He also homered more than he struck out and finished sixth all-time on the Cavaliers' career home run list and second on their RBI list. After the D-backs took him with the No. 7 overall pick in June, he posted the Northwest League's third-best average (.318) but didn't show any over-the-fence power.  The power wasn't there for Smith in his first full season either, as he finished with 11 homers in 120 games in the hitter-friendly California League. He did, however, swing the bat better as the summer unfolded, hitting .297\/.362\/.432 over his final 51 contests. At his best, Smith rarely swings and misses and drives the ball to all fields well from the left side of the plate. But he got away from those strengths and become too pull-heavy in 2018, trying to force his power rather than let it happen naturally, as a product of his all-around improvements.  Going forward, the D-backs want Smith to focus simply on being a good hitter.

After helping Oregon State win the College World Series, he signed for $6,411,400 and batted .303 in his pro debut while advancing to Class A Advanced. Madrigal's introduction to pro ball reinforced why scouts considered him the best pure hitter in the 2018 Draft. Unfazed by advanced competition, he used his controlled right-handed swing to spray line drives all over the field while striking out just five times in 173 plate appearances.

His fading changeup is his most reliable secondary offering and can be a well above average pitch at its best. Beede has the pure stuff to be a mid-rotation starter and outside of a groin injury that ended his 2017 season six weeks early, he has been durable throughout his pro career.

A return to that level in 2017 was much better for the right-hander.\r\nFernandez was 19 for all of the '16 season and he is still learning how to pitch with his high-octane stuff. At the lower levels, he could get away with just blowing it by hitters, but as he starts to get challenged more to make pitches, he'll have to set up his pitches better and have a plan of attack. He has the weapons to do so. His fastball touches 99-100 mph at times, but his slider -- which eventually should be an average breaking ball -- isn't currently good enough to keep guys off of his fastball, and he got hit more than he should. His changeup is currently his best secondary offering.\r\nFernandez has much to work on in terms of his command, getting ahead in the count early and his overall pitchability, but he'll also be just 20 for all of the 2017 season, with more than enough time to figure things out.","label":0},{"name":"hunter dozier","player_id":"641531","report":"Dozier's strong performance during his junior year, in a spring light on college performers at the plate, helped him move up boards as the 2013 Draft approached.

Patino is both athletic and physically strong for his age, with present feel for throwing and locating four pitches. His quick right arm generates a fastball that's been up to 98 mph and usually sits in the low-to-mid-90s with late life thanks to his extension toward the plate. Patino's power slider in the upper 80s is a swing-and-miss offering, and he also shows aptitude for executing an above-average curveball as well as a changeup that stands to improve as he gains experience.

He sits in the mid-90s with a lively fastball that he pairs with an above-average breaking ball. He misses bats with both pitches, while the crossfire in Diaz's delivery gives him natural deception and makes him especially tough on right-handed hitters. His changeup remains a work in progress, though Diaz has made strides in developing in the past year to the point where it's at least usable against left-handed hitters.

His 82-85 mph slider can be his best pitch at times, though he can lapse into relying on it too heavily and it isn't as consistent as his fastball. He has yet to use his changeup much in game action but showed some aptitude for throwing it during fall practice at Iowa Western.\r\nBecause he's relatively inexperienced for his age, Tillo is still figuring out control and command, but his athleticism should help him do so.

He shows some ability to draw the walks and use the whole field, but he's too aggressive at the plate. Demeritte struck out in 35 percent of his plate appearances over his first three pro seasons, in large part because he's still figuring out how to deal with breaking pitches.\r\n\r\nA shortstop in high school, Demeritte has a strong arm and average speed that many scouts thought would fit best at third base. With Adrian Beltre and Joey Gallo at third base, the Rangers moved him to second base in 2014. Demeritte had adapted well to his new position and should become at least an average defender there.

Even so, the Angels liked his arm strength, and they got him from the Twins for Hector Santiago at the non-waiver Trade Deadline. \r\n\r\nIf he can return to health, Meyer still has premium velocity, with his upper-90s fastball coming from his 6-foot-9 frame getting on hitters quickly.

Jenista does have one of the best combinations of physicality and athleticism among the college hitters in the 2018 Draft class. He has excellent hand-eye coordination that helps him barrel up the ball, though he did struggle with breaking stuff. He has more of a line-drive approach at the plate, but given his size and strength, there's plenty of raw power for him to tap into as he develops as a hitter. He'll take walks and work counts. Though he's 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, he's an above-average runner and even showed he can play a capable center field in the Cape.

The Mets liked his arm strength enough to add him to the 40-man roster following the 2017 season to protect him from being selected in the Rule 5 Draft.

He doesn't always have a feel for where it's going, however, walking 4.7 per nine innings in 2017. His slider will flash plus, but is also inconsistent, and he will need to land it for strikes to keep progressing. He also has an interesting changeup that could help him, especially against left-handed hitters, if he commits to throwing it. Right now, Bautista is all about premium velocity and projection.

The Twins didn't get the best look at Alcala after the trade, as the right-hander was a little dinged up and fatigued at season's end, so they are excited to see him at full strength. Alcala has watched his velocity climb as he's progressed and is now up in the 95-98 mph range consistently with good life. His secondary stuff has gotten better, and he missed more bats in 2018, though he's still working on their refinement. His slider and curve are both power breaking balls that run into each other at times and his changeup does get too firm. More than anything, it will be Alcala's command that determines his ultimate role.

Bahr sits in the low 90s with his fastball as a starter and has reached 96 mph in shorter stints. He has a lanky 6-foot-5 frame with room to add strength and thus more velocity, though at age 23 it's unclear how much projection he has remaining. He doesn't need to throw harder, however, because his heater plays up because of his extension and high spin rate. While he comes with low mileage on his arm, Bahr also lacks experience and needs to refine his secondary pitches. He has made encouraging progress with his curveball in the early going in 2018, giving hope that it can become a solid breaking ball, but his changeup is still in its nascent stages.

He made the decision despite changes in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that limited his bonus to no more than $3.56 million; under the old CBA, he likely would have commanded a contract worth more than $200 million. Known as the Babe Ruth of Japan, Ohtani is a two-way star who appears determined to both hit and pitch in the big leagues and is expected to make that a stipulation of signing with a team. Though he was limited in 2017 by a right ankle injury that required surgery in October, he was Japan's Pacific League MVP when fully healthy the year before. In 2016, he went 10-4 with a 1.86 ERA and 174 strikeouts in 140 innings while batting .322\/.416\/.588 with 22 homers in 104 games.

He threw the fastest recorded pitch in Japanese history (102.5 mph in 2016), sits in the upper 90s with late finish on his heater and maintains premium velocity into the late innings. Both his diving splitter, which reaches the low 90s, and his hard slider, which climbs into the high 80s, can be plus-plus pitches at their best. He also employs a curveball and a changeup that are at least average. Though he has an athletic frame and repeatable delivery, his walk rate (3.3 per nine innings) was ordinary in Japan.  While the consensus among scouts is that Ohtani has more upside as a pitcher, he also has the tools to be a star as a hitter. He has top-of-the-scale raw power and launches tape-measure shots with ease from the left side of the plate. He struck out in 27 percent of his plate appearances in Japan, so he doesn't project as a .300 hitter, but he could bat .270 with 30-plus homers per year. He's also a well-above-average runner, though his speed has yet to translate into stolen bases. He has a cannon arm and should be at least an average defender in right field.

Despite a torn labrum suffered during his first full season in 2015, and a broken thumb that kept him from going to the Arizona Fall League at the end of 2017, it's hard to argue Tucker isn't way ahead of the curve after reaching Double-A shortly following his 21st birthday. Cole's offensive game continues to grow as he matures. The switch-hitter is more natural from the left side, but his overall approach has improved and his walk rate has gone up. He makes a lot of contact and there should be more power to come as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. Tucker led the Florida State League in stolen bases even though he was promoted after 68 games and topped the organization in steals with 47 in 2017. That speed helps him defensively as well, and he should stay at short long-term, with an arm that has bounced back to a tick above average since that shoulder surgery. The Pirates have some depth at shortstop at the upper levels with Tucker and Kevin Newman. Watching that competition unfold should be a lot of fun as both come close to knocking on the door.","label":1},{"name":"michael gigliotti","player_id":"669377","report":"Scouts voted Gigliotti the Cape Cod League's top prospect in the summer of 2016 and he looked set to join Bo McLaughlin (Astros, 1975) as the only first-round picks ever from Lipscomb before his stock dropped when he slumped early last spring. He slid to the Royals in the fourth round despite a strong finish, then signed for $397,500 and hit .320\/.420\/.456 with 22 steals in 64 pro games. His 2018 season lasted just six games because he blew out the anterior-cruciate ligament in his right knee on a play in the outfield and required reconstructive surgery. With his all-fields, line-drive approach, plate discipline and ability to bunt for hits, Gigliotti can be an on-base machine. He also has well above-average speed and the know-how to steal bases, though it remains to see how his injury will affect his quickness. He has ordinary bat speed and doesn't try to drive the ball very often, so he won't produce much power. Gigliotti's quickness also plays well on defense, and he rivals Bubba Starling as the best center-field defender among Royals farmhands. He has below-average arm strength but it's playable in center.

After drafting Carter Kieboom with the first of back-to-back first-round picks, the Nationals grabbed Dunning at No. 29 and gave him a $2 million bonus. They traded him to the White Sox six months later in a three-prospect package for Adam Eaton.\r\nDunning did make some starts for the Gators on Tuesdays, but because of him being needed to relieve on weekends, there weren't many ideal chances to evaluate him in the role. However, many scouts feel he has the stuff to be in a rotation at the next level. Dunning has a plus fastball, up to 95 mph, sitting 92-93 mph and with outstanding movement. He has a very good feel for his changeup as well. His breaking ball is fringy, but shows glimpses of being an average offering. Dunning's arm is so quick that he sometimes struggles with keeping the ball down in the zone, an issue most feel is correctable.\r\nDunning reminds some of another talented Gators arm who had trouble finding rotation innings in college: Anthony DeSclafani.

Eased into the professional ranks as the Rays often do with their young hurlers, Franklin impressed during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and built upon that performance in 2017 while helping to pace Class A Short Season Hudson Valley to a New York-Penn League title.  Franklin is physically mature for his age, with a body that's built for starting games but also requires further projection. A good athlete with a clean arm action, he's been clocked up to 95 mph with his fastball and sits comfortably in the low 90s with heavy sink, and scouts like his chances of adding more velocity. His power 11-to-5 curveball has late bite and the makings of a plus pitch, and he's made strides in improving his changeup since entering the professional ranks. Franklin's control will require further refinement, but he has all the physical tools to become a strike-thrower with all three pitches.

While he was a little more uneven in some aspects of his performance, his pure stuff excited the Phillies enough for him to be added to the 40-man roster this past offseason.  Pure stuff-wise, Medina's is as electric as perhaps any prospect's in baseball and when he's locked in, he can be virtually unhittable. He uses his three-pitch mix to miss a lot of bats, striking out 10 per nine innings in his first two years of full-season ball. His fastball now comfortably sits in the 92-94 mph range and he can easily touch 95-96 mph, commanding the pitch well. Medina also throws it with a ton of movement, getting ground-ball outs at a consistent clip. Both his sharp slider and his changeup flash plus at times.  Medina throws a lot of strikes, but he's still learning to harness his premium stuff within the zone, and it was inconsistencies with that which sometimes led to him getting hit in the Florida State League.

He has had trouble gaining traction since, scuffling in his first full year and missing nearly all of 2018 due to first forearm stiffness then a strained oblique. Based on his profile and Draft status, Pint certainly hasn't lived up to expectations thus far. The good news is he's still only 21 years old and the premium stuff that excited everyone coming out of high school is still very much there. The 6-foot-4 righty still cranks his fastball up to 97-100 mph consistently. The Rockies feel he has the best curve in the system, one that flashes as a 70 pitch, though not consistently. His above-average slider also can buckle knees and his fading changeup gives him a fourth pitch that grades out as at least above-average. The one thing, other than health, that has held him back has been his ability to command the baseball. It will come down to him finding a way to control his effort and body, which will allow him to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone more consistently.

Drafted fourth overall by Tampa Bay in June, McKay received the second-highest signing bonus ($7,007,500) under the current set of Draft rules.  McKay operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that he commands well against hitters on both sides of the plate, though his velocity is prone to dipping as he works deeper into games. Both his curveball and cutter project to be above-average pitches, and he showed good feel for a changeup during his pro debut after using it sparingly at Louisville.  At the plate, McKay's smooth left-handed swing and mature all-fields approach led some evaluators to label him the best college bat in his class as a potential .300 hitter capable of hitting 20 homers per season. His lack of speed limits him to first base, but he proved a sound defender during his pro debut, and could become above average in time.","label":0},{"name":"victor caratini","player_id":"605170","report":"After playing with Carlos Correa at the Puerto Rico Baseball Academy, Caratini planned on playing college baseball at Southern.

He has improved significantly behind the plate and throws and receives well enough to stay there, though he has more work to do. He has a solid arm but must upgrade his accuracy.\r\nA switch-hitter, Caratini focuses on making line-drive contact with an easy stroke rather than turning on pitches and driving the ball.

The right-hander was a consistent member of the Triple-A rotation, making his big league debut last July. De Los Santos has two pitches, his fastball and changeup, that are ready to get big league hitters out. He'll throw his fastball typically in the 92-95 mph range and will sit at 93-94 with comfort, showing the ability to reach back for a bit more at times. He'll miss bats and get groundball outs with it when he's at his best. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, one that flashes plus and has good fade to it. His breaking ball remains behind his other two offerings. On a good day, he'll show an average pitch, but it's often slurvy and some see it as more of a slider than a curveball. Just 23 for all of the 2019 season, De Los Santos has shown he has the durability to remain in a rotation and the Phillies aren't ready to give up on him as a starter just yet.

But Baez has gotten back on track this season in his return to Hagerstown, where he's consistently missing bats and showing the ability to work deeper into games. \r\nThe 6-foot-3 right-hander has big-time arm strength, working at 92-95 mph and topping out at 96 with his fastball, but his velocity is consistent because he struggles to repeat his delivery. That said, Baez is just starting to grow into his wiry frame, and scouts envision him operating in the mid- to upper-90s once developed. His curveball has the makings of an average pitch, one thrown in the high 70s with decent depth and shape, although his inconsistent release point compromises its effectiveness. Baez's changeup is a work in progress, and he'll need to develop it thoroughly to remain a starter.\r\nBaez's inconsistent mechanics and lack of a third pitch make him to difficult to project as a starter long term, but, at age 21, he still has time on his side.

When Chicago called him up in July, he gave the Billikens their first big leaguer since Len Boehmer in 1971. Norwood topped out at 98 mph in college and currently sits at 94-97 and reaches 100 with run on his fastball. His lack of a reliable secondary pitch handicapped him when he worked out of the rotation, but he since has improved his mid-80s slider and developed an upper-80s splitter to keep hitters off his heater. Both offerings can be solid at times but also are inconsistent. The effort in Norwood's delivery also worked against him when he was a starter.

There's power there, too, and while he won't sacrifice his approach for the long ball, he should start sending more balls over the fence as he matures. He may never be a Gold Glove winner, but he's developed into a dependable left fielder.\r\n\r\nAs the best hitter, especially left-handed, the Reds have developed since Jay Bruce, Winker is often compared to the Reds' right fielder.

Unfortunately, Jansen's promising campaign was derailed in late May when a broken bone in his left hand -- which suffered on a hitter's follow-through -- forced him to the disabled list. Injuries continued to plague Jansen in 2016, when a broken hamate in his left hand in early May sidelined him for nearly two months.\r\nA right-handed hitter, Jansen has solid power potential thanks to his bat speed and big, strong build. He makes a lot of contact and has a good feel for the strike zone, making him difficult to strike out. But his biggest strides have been made behind the plate, where he exhibits good receiving skills and has worked to improve his throwing.\r\nDeveloping high school catchers takes time, and Jansen could ultimately require quite a bit of seasoning after missing crucial developmental time.

Seeking both value and stability after targeting upside in the first two rounds, the Indians took Ice with the No. 72 overall pick and, after signing him for slightly less than pick value, assigned him to the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. \r\nIce might not have the offensive profile of some of the premier college backstops from the 2016 class, but that doesn't mean he's not without skills at the plate. The switch-hitter displayed a very good feel for hitting during his junior season, hitting for average and some extra-base ability, while walking more than he struck out. \r\nCompared to those offensive-minded collegians, though, Ice has a better chance to stick behind the plate.

A low-80s slider that flashes above average and fringy changeup comprises Hanifee's secondary arsenal, and everything he throws plays up on account of his advanced pitchability and command.\r\nScouts believe Hanifee's velocity will tick up as he adds strength to his lean, 6-foot-5 frame. His smooth delivery and clean arm action lend credence to that thought, giving the young righty a solid foundation to start long term.

Once upon a time, people saw Wilson as a future reliever because of his size, stuff and bulldog mentality. A former high school football player, Wilson goes right after hitters with his three-pitch arsenal. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but he's shown the ability to ratchet it up to 97-98 mph at times, and he throws it with a lot of sink to get ground-ball outs. His breaking ball still gets slurvy at times and can look like a slider or a curve depending on when you see it, but it's an effective pitch, especially when it's harder and tighter.

He wasn't able to carve out a full-time role in Detroit's crowded rotation, however, and, almost exactly a year after being traded to the Tigers he was included in a three-team deal that sent him to the D-backs. \r\nRay throws his fastball in the low 90s and can reach back for a tick more velocity when he needs it. His slider can look slurvy at times, but the best ones have good depth. He has a good feel for his changeup, which is a more consistent offering. His command has improved, but he would benefit from further refinement. \r\nRay is a good athlete and has proven to be durable, throwing more than 100 innings in each of the last three years.

He logged a 6.25 ERA with 46 walks in 36 innings while repeating the Rookie-level Appalachian League last season. Medina has electric arm speed that generates 95-100 mph fastballs with little effort, peaking at 102 with some cutting action. His high-spin curveball gives him a second plus-plus pitch at its best, combining power in the low 80s with sharp break. His low-90s changeup has splitter action and gives him a third weapon that can make hitters look silly.  Medina is athletic and has no glaring flaws in his delivery, helping his chances of developing at least the decent command he'll need to succeed. Some observers believe his strike-throwing issues are more mental than physical. He has the upside of a frontline starter with a more realistic expectation of becoming a difference-making reliever, and the Yankees will give him plenty of time to figure things out.","label":0},{"name":"starling heredia","player_id":"665752","report":"A standout on the international showcase circuit, Heredia routinely dazzled scouts with his power\/speed combination and finished second in the home run derby at the 2014 Under Armour All-America Game.

He offers tantalizing upside but also the widest gap between his ceiling and floor of any Dodgers farmhand.\r\nHeredia has tape-measure power thanks to lightning bat speed, prodigious strength (he weighs much more than his listed 200 pounds) and the leverage in his right-handed swing. There are times when he keeps his stroke compact and shows the ability to make adjustments, and others when his swing gets much too long and he looks lost at the plate. He looked overmatched when he reached low Class A last August and again this spring before an eye injury sidelined him in June.\r\nHeredia moves well for his size, showing average speed out of the batter's box and a step more quickness once he gets going, though he'll slow down as he continues to get bigger. He has played all three outfield positions as a pro, getting most of his action in left field.

The Reds selected him in the big league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in December and immediately sold him to the Royals, who may give him a chance to win a job in their rotation. The key to Keller's success is locating his low-90s sinker, which he didn't do as consistently in 2017.

He lived up to this reputation in his professional debut, finishing in the United States with a taste of the Gulf Coast League after he had raked in Dominican Summer League.  Hiraldo's impressive pro debut underscored his potential at the plate. Strong beyond his years, he has plus bat speed and impacts the ball using a quick, compact swing in which he generates huge extension through contact, driving the ball with back-spin carry. He has innate feel for finding the barrel, too, though his approach can be too pull-oriented, and he'll struggle with spin at times. The consistent gap power he showed in 2018, on top of his aforementioned swing mechanics, gives scouts the impression that Hiraldo could be good for 20-plus homers annually in his prime.  Questions pertaining to Hiraldo's ability to stick at shortstop long-term will continue to follow him as he moves through the Minors, but he handled the position well during in pro debut, albeit while relying on his sheer athleticism and above-average arm strength.

Marcano batted .366\/.450\/.438, while showcasing some of the most advanced knowledge of the strike zone in the organization; he struck out 16 times and walked 30. Marcano is a slender and wiry middle-infield type, who needs to fill out his 6-foot frame. When he does, he could grow into some power. But his contact skills are the defining characteristic. Marcano's short left-handed stroke produces line drives all over the field, and he has a knack for hard contact. He complements his excellent plate approach with above-average speed, though he still needs to hone his base-stealing.  Defensively, the Padres are convinced Marcano can remain at shortstop, and he's got the quick hands necessary to be a solid defender. His arm projects as merely average, and in a Padres system loaded with shortstop options, that could force a move to second base.

Peterson's fastball is average in terms of velocity, as he'll sit at 89-91 mph and touch 93, but few starters in the Minors can sink and command it as well as he does. Logging 127 1\/3 innings in his first full season, Peterson yielded only two home runs (0.14 HR\/9) and posted the third-best ground-ball rate (64.5%) in the Minors among qualified pitchers. He combines his heater with an above-average slider that nets him whiffs as an out pitch, while his changeup, which flashes above-average, gives him a weapon against right-handed hitters. He fills out his four-pitch mix with a fringy curveball that he can throw for a strike.

He uses an extreme opposite field approach and while he's never going to be a huge power guy, if he can learn to turn on pitches to his pull side more, there is some extra-base impact for him to unlock. Arraez has largely played second as a pro, though he saw some time at third, short and even a bit in the outfield in 2018, then played a lot at the hot corner in winter ball.

Crouse has a lot going on in his violent delivery, which finishes with some disconcerting head whack, yet he repeats it and keeps it in sync enough to find the strike zone on a regular basis. He's more animated than most pitchers, and he'll throw in a Johnny Cueto shimmy or groom the mound like Mark Fidrych at times.

Once one of the Yankees' most highly regarded pitching prospects, he saw his stock take a hit in 2018 when he missed six weeks with blister issues and his velocity dipped. Though his fastball has been clocked as high as 103 mph, Acevedo spent most of last year working at 92-97. He uses his 6-foot-7 frame and low-three-quarters arm slot to create angle and deception, so his heater can survive on more than sheer velocity. That slot has made it difficult to stay on top of his mid-80s slider, which is more hard than sharp and never has been very reliable. Acevedo's changeup was less consistent than usual last year, though it can be a plus pitch when he doesn't overthrow it and gets it to dive at the plate. Though he's a tall pitcher with effort in his delivery, he keeps it in sync and has a history of throwing strikes.

After ranking among the Midwest League leaders with 22 home runs (third) and pacing all Indians farmhands with 73 runs scored in his first full season, Capel took a step back in 2018 and became Cardinals property in July when they acquired him and Jhon Torres for Oscar Mercado.  With his combination of strength, bat speed and an improved bat path, Capel showed in his first full season that he could hit the ball out to the deepest part of any ballpark, albeit at the cost of more swing-and-miss. In 2018, he made a concerted effort to make more contact and utilized a shorter, less-fluid swing that in turn zapped both his raw and game power, as he followed up his 22-homer campaign by tallying 34 extra-base hits over 118 games in Class A Advanced.  Capel's above-average speed and strong instincts are qualifiers for him on the basepaths and in center field, and he has the arm strength -- he generated 90-mph fastballs off the mound in high school -- to play either corner spot.

But he's capable of playing shortstop as well, though his range -- thanks to his fringy speed -- is probably better suited for the right side of the diamond. Betancourt isn't all glove, though, with a very good feel for making consistent contact. He doesn't walk very much, but he also doesn't strike out a ton. He's an advanced offensive player for his age, one who has a line-drive approach to all fields and has the chance to add a little pop as he matures.\r\n\r\nAlong with top prospect Orlando Arcia, the Brewers could produce an interesting double-play combination in the coming years.","label":0},{"name":"jason hursh","player_id":"592422","report":"Hursh underwent Tommy John surgery as a sophomore at Oklahoma State but came back strong the next year, and the Braves selected him in the first round in 2013.

As a result, he creates a lot of groundball outs and surrenders very few home runs. His curveball and changeup give him two more solid offerings, and he aggressively attacks hitters and throws strikes with all three of his pitches.\r\n\r\nHursh earns praise for his makeup and understanding of his craft.

At the start of the dynamic duo's junior season in 2018, there were some scouts who thought Kowar might be better long-term, though Singer rose to the top and Kowar slotted in as a very nice 1a. Much to the delight of the Royals, both college arms were available to them, so the Gators can now be Royals together as well, and Kowar made a nice first impression during his brief summer debut in the South Atlantic League. Kowar has the chance to have three at least average pitches, with his fastball and changeup standing out as plus offerings. His changeup is his best pitch, thrown with excellent deception and arm speed that tumbles and fades. His fastball will top out at 97 and sit more in the 94-95 mph range. A solid strike thrower, Kowar's fastball command has room for improvement as he learns to repeat his delivery more consistently, but it's not a red flag in any way. When he was first drafted, it was suggested to the Royals player development staff that they look at a slider instead of what had been an inconsistent curveball in college. But Kowar spun a better version of the pitch during his debut, with good shape, and it's now an average breaking ball with a chance to be better than that. Kowar gets high marks for holding runners well and fielding his position, and his athleticism should help him maximize his delivery long term.

Rodon didn't dominate as much as expected, and he lasted until the third pick, where the White Sox gave him a $6,582,000 bonus -- the largest in franchise history and the largest ever for a lefty.\r\nRodon's best pitch is a true wipeout slider that usually arrives in the mid-80s and probably could abuse big league hitters right now. He relied on it too heavily during his junior season, which cost him some fastball velocity. Rodon operated in the low 90s for much of the spring, but he has shown the ability to reach 97 mph.\r\nRodon's changeup regressed some, as well, but it can overmatch hitters when it's at its best.

He passed on signing with the Cubs as a 37th-round pick and honored his commitment to San Diego, where his defense drew mixed reviews from scouts, but his bat did not. An All-Star turn in the Cape Cod League, followed by a powerful junior campaign earned him a third-round selection by the Blue Jays in 2017, and he continued to impress during his pro debut in the Class A Short Season Northwest League. Adams struggled in 2018 following an assignment straight to the Class A Advanced Florida State League, but he fared better during his return to the level early in 2019. Adams has shown some ability at the plate and increased his power output in each of his three years as a starter at San Diego. He's a physical specimen, possessing both size and strength that leads the Blue Jays to believe he'll eventually tap into more raw power in the pro ranks. Improving his setup at the plate should help in that regard, and he's made a concerted effort to better use the entire field after employing a more pull-heavy approach in college. There is some swing-and-miss to his game, but he also works deep at-bats and draws his share of walks, leading to solid on-base rates.  Adams earns high praise from club officials for his all-around defensive skills and his feel for controlling a game and managing pitchers. His arm strength is only average, but strong catch-and-throw skills enable him to limit the running game, as evidenced by his 45.7 percent caught-stealing rate in his first full season. Those defensive chops could make Adams a backup catcher at the highest level, and any additional progress at the plate could thrust him into consideration for an everyday role.","label":0},{"name":"andrew oliver","player_id":"501989","report":"When the Tigers drafted this Oklahoma State lefty, the hope was that he\u2019d be a quick riser to the big leagues.

One year later, the 19-year-old backstop made his long awaited pro debut in the Gulf Coast League, and did so as a catcher rather than first base or designated hitter.\r\nOne of the more interesting prep hitters in the 2015 class, Betts makes hard contact from the left side of the plate thanks to a smooth and controlled swing that has little wasted movement. He's physically strong and gets good use of his lower half, and scouts believe his impressive raw power could develop into above-average power.\r\nThere were questions about whether Betts would stay behind the plate long-term even before the elbow surgery. When healthy, his arm strength is his best defensive tool, though he'll need to shorten his arm stroke and clean up his transfer skills.

His plate discipline is also impressive, as he accrued more walks (76) than strikeouts (62) in 2017 to finish among the Minor League leaders in on-base percentage. Moved from the outfield to third base before the season, Guerrero shows glimpses of becoming a passable defender there in spite of having below-average speed and range.

One of the biggest causes for the fade, something that also happened in 2017, was a lack of strength that led to questions of durability. To his credit, Gordon learned a lesson last year and worked hard this offseason to add strength. When he's doing well, he has an excellent line-drive approach that leads to good contact, and he showed early on last year that there is some extra-base authority in his left-handed swing. An average runner, Gordon won't wow anyone on the basepaths or in the field, but his plus instincts help him steal bases and be more than capable on both sides of second base and still have the chance to be a solid big-league regular.

The most asked-about Royals prospect at the 2017 Trade Deadline, he recorded a 1.67 ERA in his first two pro seasons and made his way to Double-A a year after signing.\r\nLovelady's fastball velocity has risen from 90-93 mph with the Owls to 93-97 in the Minors. He throws from a low arm slot that adds life and angle to his pitches, generating lots of strikeouts and groundouts. Kansas City encouraged him to use his secondary pitches more when he reached Double-A, where he learned that his improved mid-80s slider can be effective against both left-handers and right-handers.\r\nLovelady also has a changeup but primarily works with his main two pitches out of the bullpen. He's repeating his delivery more consistently as a professional, resulting in improved control and command. It's not out of the question that he could become the top southpaw in the Royals' big league bullpen in just his second full year in pro ball.","label":1},{"name":"rafael bautista","player_id":"622441","report":"Bautista made a name for himself by finishing second in the Minors with 69 stolen bases in his 2014 full-season debut at Class A Hagerstown.

After making his big league debut in April of this year in the wake of Adam Eaton's season-ending injury, Bautista returned to Triple-A and suffered a torn hamstring that will likely sideline him until September. \r\nBautista's double-plus speed is easily his top tool and gives him impact potential on both sides of the ball,and he's always a threat to run when on base. He also shows good feel to hit from the right side, is a skilled bunter and knows how to work counts, making him an candidate to hit at the top of a lineup.\r\nDefensively, Bautista gets good reads off the bat and has range for days in center field.

He served as a mid-week starter for part of his freshman year before finding his niche as the Tigers' closer the next two years. That late-inning potential earned Gilliam a fifth-round selection by the Mets in 2018, and he excelled as Short-Season Class A Brooklyn's closer in his pro debut, saving five games and averaging better than 16 strikeouts per nine across 17 appearances.  Gilliam may be undersized, listed at 5-foot-10, but he has a super quick arm that produces a plus fastball at 96-97 mph. His curveball gives him a second plus pitch, registering in the upper 70s with downer action. He can induce whiffs with both pitches, and did so at a 17-percent clip in his pro debut while striking out nearly 42 percent of the hitters he faced. Gilliam works with a high-tempo delivery that adds some funk and deception, but also makes it difficult for him to control his offerings at times. He averaged 4.7 walks per nine in college, followed by 6.8 in the New York-Penn League.  That Gilliam is a good athlete reduces some of the durability concerns that his size creates, and it should also allow him to make gains in terms of harnessing his stuff. If he can learn to do that, Gilliam could rise quickly through the Minors en route to a late-inning role in the Majors.","label":0},{"name":"kristian robinson","player_id":"677565","report":"Most people think of the Bahamas as a vacation destination.

The Ontario native makes hard contact to all fields thanks to his plus bat speed and excellent hand-eye coordination, and he also keeps the barrel in the zone longer than most young sluggers. Naylor does not have much swing-and-miss to his game in spite of an aggressive approach, but he'll need to become more selective as he moves up the ladder and sees better secondary pitches.\r\n\r\nThough a good athlete for a player his size, Naylor's bottom-of-the-scale speed limits him to first base, where scouts project him as a below-average defender.

He offered one of the best power\/speed combinations available, which prompted the Giants to draft him 19th overall and sign him for $3,101,700. He continued to perform well in his pro debut, leading the Rookie-level Arizona League in slugging (.645) and finishing second in batting (.348) and OPS (1.049). While he needs a few years of development time, Ramos has the highest ceiling of any Giants prospect since Buster Posey. His bat speed and strength generate well-above-average power from the right side of the plate, and he already shows the ability to drive the ball out of the park to all fields. Part of an athletic family that includes brothers in the Dodgers system (Henry, an outfielder) and on Puerto Rico's national soccer team (Hector), Heliot has at least plus speed as well as solid arm strength. The biggest question with Ramos is whether he can develop a more patient approach and make consistent contact so he can realize his offensive potential.

The left-hander has continued to pile up strikeouts since entering the professional ranks, as he posted a 12.4 K\/9 during his pro debut and followed it with 11.0 K\/9 in his first full season, much of which he spent at Class A Advanced Frederick. Lowther's track record of missing bats is testament to his dominant fastball. He throws the pitch with only fringy velocity, sitting at 87-91 mph and occasionally bumping a few ticks higher. However, the massive extension he generates to the plate, combined with his fast arm and slightly lower slot, gives the pitch a high spin rate and late riding life that enables him to consistently beat hitters within and above the strike zone. An above-average curveball and a tumbling, low-80s changeup that's at least average comprise Lowther's secondary arsenal, and he keeps hitters off balance with both pitches.  Physically mature and durable, Lowther has long shown that he can handle a heavy workload.

His changeup is his best weapon, an offspeed pitch he'll throw to both left- and right-handed hitters. He'll mix in his fringy slider effectively and is an extreme strike-thrower with all three as more of a ground ball, pitch-to-contact, guy than a strikeout pitcher. While Jax is lean, he is in excellent military shape and he has a bit of a bulldog mentality on the mound, perhaps handed down by his father, former NFL linebacker Garth Jax.

His spike curveball can be more devastating and also harder to control, combining power and 12-to-6 break. Both Adams and Widener added velocity and maintained it over a full season after shifting to the rotation, and if that happens with Otto he could have a pair of well-above-average pitches. Otto rarely employed a changeup in college, so adding a reliable third pitch will be a focal point of his development. Improving his control and command are also on his to-do list after he averaged 4.5 walks per nine innings at Rice.

While he had more of a curveball as an amateur, he rarely uses it, instead going to a harder slider he learned in extended spring ball that he throws 81-84 mph with good two-plane action. His changeup is still a little firm -- around 87 mph -- but it has good action at times and it could give him a third average pitch in time.   Patience will continue to be key for the right-hander who will still be just 19 years old for all of the 2018 season.

Stephenson's biggest issues in 2014 were with his command, as the Futures Gamer saw his walk rate jump more than two walks per nine innings from the previous season. He still missed plenty of bats, but he was more a thrower than a pitcher for much of the season.\r\n\r\nStephenson's stuff is still as electric as just about any pitching prospect in baseball. He pitched all of the 2015 season at age 22, with plenty of time to develop a better feel for pitching and become the frontline starter the Reds envisioned when they drafted him.","label":1},{"name":"leody taveras","player_id":"665750","report":" A cousin of former big league stolen-base champ Willy Taveras, Leodys signed for $2.1 million out of the Dominican Republic as one of the top athletes on the 2015-16 international amateur market. The Rangers brought him to the United States at age 17 and have promoted him aggressively, making him the youngest regular in the short-season Northwest League during his 2016 debut, the third-youngest in the low Class A South Atlantic League last season and the second-youngest in the high Class A Carolina League this year. While he hasn't posted huge numbers, he also hasn't been overmatched and his tools have been obvious. Taveras is a switch-hitter with a good swing from both sides of the plate -- the consensus is that he's better as a left-handed hitter -- and he already displays command of the strike zone and the ability to recognize pitches. Add in his plus speed and he should have little difficulty hitting for average. With his easy bat speed and projectable strength, he also could grow into at least average power once he matures physically. While Tavares still is learning how to translate his quickness into stolen bases, he already uses his speed well in center field. He gets good reads and jumps, allowing him to chase down balls from gap to gap. He also has solid arm strength that fits well at any of the three outfield spots, though he won't have to move from center.","label":0},{"name":"d.j. stewart","player_id":"621466","report":"Stewart took home Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year honors as a Florida State sophomore in 2014 after he led the conference in all three triple-slash categories. He followed it up with a strong junior campaign, and the Orioles nabbed him with the first of their two first-round picks in June. After a sluggish start to his pro career, Stewart revamped his swing and began to put it all together in 2017, totaling 21 homers and 20 steals in Double-A. His production was less consistent last season in Triple-A, and he also missed some time with a hamstring injury, but the Orioles still gave him a look as a September callup, a challenge to which Stewart responded by hitting .250 with three homers in 17 games.  The open, over-exaggerated crouch that Stewart employed at FSU has evolved into a more upright and closed-off stance as a pro. It's enabled him to make better use of his hands and wrists, helping him catch up to velocity and tap into some power, though, overall, his swing lacks versatility. Stewart's patient approach and strong on-base skills have long been strengths, and he offers value on the basepaths with his average speed. A good athlete despite his stocky build, he's a fringy defender at both outfielder corners, but profiles better in left field due to his below-average arm strength.  After his first taste of the Majors last season, Stewart is positioned to see even more playing time in 2019 as the Orioles continue their rebuild. An everyday role might be a stretch, given Stewart's overall profile, but he contributes in enough facets of the game to serve as useful bench player or a platoon option.","label":0},{"name":"brailyn marquez","player_id":"666622","report":" Marquez's $600,000 bonus was the largest given to any left-hander during the 2015-16 international amateur signing period. His projectable 6-foot-4 frame and a fastball that already crept into the low 90s at age 16 were his biggest selling points. He spent his first two pro seasons in Rookie ball, posting a 3.28 ERA with 100 strikeouts in 98 2\/3 innings. Marquez pitched with a 91-93 mph fastball and touched 95 last season as an 18-year-old, has topped out at 98 this year and should continue to add velocity as he gets stronger. He also has improved his curveball, which should become a solid pitch though it's still inconsistent. His changeup is in the rudimentary stages. Though he got roughed up during his 2017 U.S. debut, Marquez continually challenged hitters. His command isn't as advanced as his control and he's still a teenager with a lot to learn. But as a lefty who could regularly work in the mid-90s, he has plenty of upside and will get plenty of time to develop.","label":0},{"name":"norge ruiz","player_id":"650204","report":"Ranked No. 3 on MLBPipeline.com's list of the top 30 international prospects for 2016-17, Ruiz was declared a free agent in September following an impressive three-year career in Cuba's Serie Nacional, during which he posted a 2.55 ERA in 374 1\/3 innings. In December, the A's secured the right-hander's future with a $2 million signing bonus. After visa issues delayed the start of his season, Ruiz made his U.S. debut in June in the Rookie Arizona League, where he logged one start before advancing to Class A Advanced Stockton.\r\nRuiz's fastball sits in the 91-94 mph range and touches 95, and he's adept at creating late movement on the pitch thanks to his varying arm angels. His changeup arguably is his best secondary offering, flashing plus at times, and he also has advanced feel for a slider and a splitter. In general, he's a ground-ball pitcher who doesn't miss many bats but knows how to change speeds and keep hitters off balance.\r\nWhile not physically intimidating, Ruiz knows how to pitch and evaluators praise his bulldog mentality on the mound. Improving his control and command and generating more whiffs could go a long way in helping him carve out a role as a backend starter, though he could also offer plenty value coming out of the bullpen, where his stuff stands to play up.","label":0},{"name":"jon duplantier","player_id":"641541","report":"A shoulder injury that kept him out for his entire sophomore season combined with the track record of pitchers coming out of Rice hurt Duplantier's stock leading into the 2016 Draft despite a healthy junior campaign. Those concerns weren't assuaged when he threw just one inning in his pro debut due to elbow soreness, but he took a huge step toward erasing doubts with a dominant and healthy first full season that saw him lead the Minors in ERA while pitching across two levels and attending the Futures Game. Some of those questions resurfaced a bit, though, when he was shelved for an extended period in 2018 with arm fatigue.\r\nStrong and athletic, Duplantier has helped remake his delivery with remarkable success. While his fastball usually sits in the 92-94 mph range, he can reach back for more when needed. He throws it with sink and run and was as effective in getting ground-ball outs as he was in missing bats in 2017. He added a slider to his arsenal and it might end up being his best secondary offering, with plus potential. He still throws an effective curveball as well. He has feel for a changeup, giving him the chance for a very effective four-pitch mix. He's around the strike zone more than enough to remain a starter.\r\nDuplantier was meeting the challenge of the upper levels well before he was shut down.

He was relatively healthy in 2016 but didn't come close to producing like he did back in Brooklyn, though he bounced back with a more productive 2017 in his third go-round with St. Lucie.\r\n\r\nUrena shows a solid approach at the plate, with a good walk rate and not a lot of swing-and-miss to his game. He does, however, get pull happy and needs to find the middle of the field more consistently, though he's been better from the left side than the right thus far in terms of his hit tool. When he gets too big, he gets himself into trouble and needs to trust that his raw power will show up naturally. A fair third baseman with a strong arm, Urena started getting some time at first in 2016, partially because some thought he'd have to move there eventually, and partially to improve his versatility with other more advanced defenders at the hot corner in the organization.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the ball, Urena needs to find some consistency to reach his ultimate potential.

He made progress at the plate at Double-A in 2018, finishing with a .271 average in his first taste of the level, though the jury is still very much out if he'll ever hit enough to be an everyday player.  Alcantara is a model defender at shortstop with his cannon arm and slick glove. Though only an average runner, he has plenty of range because he has quick feet and an instinctual first step that consistently puts him in position to make plays. Offensively, the switch-hitter demonstrates a knack for making contact from both sides of the plate, with a more disciplined approach as a lefty. His feel for the barrel produces mostly line drives and ground balls, and it's unlikely that Alcantara will ever have enough strength to hit more than the occasional home run. Since power will never be a part of his game, it's crucial that Alcantara continues developing as a hitter, with an emphasis on refining his approach and improving the quality of his contact on both sides of the plate. While unlocking Alcantara's potential with the bat could push him into consideration as an everyday player, his best fit long-term in the big leagues is as a defensive-minded utilityman who helps wins games with his glove.","label":0},{"name":"corey littrell","player_id":"592511","report":"In his first full season in the Cardinals organization, Littrell finished fourth in the organization in ERA as part of a deep Palm Beach staff.

A switch to the bullpen allowed him to move quickly through those levels, earning a promotion to Triple-A after 13 Double-A outings.\r\nLittrell is the prototypical strike-throwing lefty. He has a four-pitch mix, all of which grade out as average offerings. His fastball sits in the 88-90 mph range, but it plays up because he can command it and keep it down in the zone. His secondary stuff is good enough to keep hitters off balance. Littrell used to throw a cutter, but it's more of a true slider now and it's developed into a good weapon against left-handed hitters.\r\nOut of the pen, Littrell has been missing more bats than he was as a starter.

He posted a career-best .863 OPS in low Class A before slumping to a career-worst .511 OPS in his first taste of high Class A. Arauz's .240\/.316\/.353 line in his first four pro seasons is more a reflection of being one of the youngest players in each of his leagues than an indictment of his offensive potential. He's a switch-hitter with a line-drive stroke, a good sense of the strike zone and the bat speed and deceptive strength for double-digit home run potential. His biggest problem is that he doesn't use his legs enough at the plate and makes too much weak contact. Arauz has average speed but a quicker first step that gives him the range to stay at shortstop. He's an unusually reliable defender for his age, at both shortstop and second base. His solid arm also makes him a viable option at third base, where he has seen brief action, and enhances his value as a potential utilityman.","label":0},{"name":"robert refsnyder","player_id":"608701","report":"Refsnyder led Arizona to the 2012 College World Series championship, hitting .476 with two homers to earn Most Outstanding Player honors.

He has established himself as the best pure hitter in New York's system, leading Yankees farmhands with a .318 average, 38 doubles and 256 total bases in 2014. His ability to recognize pitches and control the strike zone translates into consistent line drives to all fields.\r\nHe still figures to top out at 15 homers per season, so Refsnyder's chances of becoming a big league regular hinge on his ability to handle second base. He has made progress there but still struggles with his footwork and probably won't become more than an adequate defender.

Rosario does have decent speed, better under way, but likely isn't going to be a major basestealer. Starting out as an outfielder, he made the move to second base and made some progress there, though there's obviously still work to be done.

He's moved incrementally, from the Dominican Summer League, to the Gulf Coast League to the New York-Penn League, over three summers of pro ball, performing well at all three stops. The word that comes up the most when evaluating Silva is \"projectable.\" He shows the makings of a three-pitch mix and the ability to throw them for strikes that gives hope he can remain a starting pitcher long-term. He typically sits in the low-90s with his fastball, touching a bit higher at times, and he should add some velocity as he fills out his 6-foot-2 frame. His fastball plays up because of its life and he backs it up with a slider and changeup that both need to be developed, though the former is ahead of the latter. He both missed bats and got weak contact on the ground consistently in 2018, though he'll need to refine his command.

Bart improved offensively and defensively throughout his time with the Yellow Jackets, blossoming into the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year as a junior.  With his bat speed, strength and leverage, Bart generates power to all fields from the right side of the plate. He improved as a hitter as he has understood that he doesn't have to sell out for home runs. Bart made tremendous strides with his plate discipline during the spring, and he has the swing and feel for hitting to produce solid batting averages.  While there were questions about Bart's defensive ability when he arrived at Georgia Tech, that's not the case any longer.

He built on that success in the Arizona Fall League, where he fanned five of the six hitters he faced over two perfect innings in the annual Fall Stars Game. He excelled back in Double-A to begin 2017, moved up to Triple-A in mid-April and then starred on a national stage yet again, earning MVP honors in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game as the starter for the U.S. Team. \r\nHoneywell has a bevy of weapons at his disposal, with the ability to both throw strikes and generate whiffs with five distinct pitches.

His feel for commanding his above-average cutter down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch, while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering.\r\nWith natural athleticism, smooth mechanics and a repeatable delivery, Honeywell has proved to be a gifted strike-thrower early in his career, showing command that has improved as he's climbed the Minor League ladder.

That's not necessarily his best pitch because he also possesses a power slider with late bite that can reach 88 mph, and he also has the ability to morph it into an even harder and equally effective cutter.

He did spend the 2018 season in Double-A, but hasn't been able to fully figure out what kind of hitter he is. Randolph has shown glimpses of the hitter everyone thought he could be.

He has played six positions as a pro, getting time at third base and shortstop last year because Texas had a void in high Class A.

He missed the first 50 games in 2017 because of a suspension for testing positive for a stimulant, then posted the worst OPS of his career (.607) in his first exposure to low Class A before recording his best OPS yet (.704) in the short-season New York-Penn League. Arauz's modest statistical performance thus far is a result of being much younger than his competition and not a knock on his offensive potential. He's a switch-hitter with discipline and a propensity for making line-drive contact. His quick hands hint at untapped power, and he could produce double-digit home run totals as he adds strength and starts using his lower half more often in his swing. Though he's just an average runner, Arauz has a quick first step and good range that may enable him to stay at shortstop. His solid arm works at short and enables him to play all over the infield should he become a utilityman.

He makes consistent hard contact, and the only quibbles with his offensive game are that he rarely walks and occasionally gets pull-conscious. When Rodgers was in high school, scouts debated whether he was a long-term shortstop.

His left-handed swing is both quick and controlled, and he knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone with his long arms to generate considerable raw power, even if it is yet to manifest during games. The same bat path leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss -- his 144 strikeouts in 2017 ranked seventh among Midwest League hitters -- though he is athletic enough to make the necessary adjustments to his swing in the coming years. Once he's done so, it doesn't take much to envision him hitting for both average and power. The Rays are confident in Lowe's abilities as a hitter and see the sky as his ceiling given the remaining physical projection in his ultra-athletic frame. \r\nAfter struggling at third base during his pro debut, Lowe was shifted to center field during fall instructional league and immediately proved a natural, with his plus speed and long, graceful strides fueling his impressive range.

He did, however, make his big league debut in July, logging one at-bat with the Rays, who traded him to the Cardinals 10 days later in the Tommy Pham deal.  Williams has always intrigued scouts with his natural hitting ability and projectable power, but it hasn't come together for him as quickly as it seemed it might earlier in his career. He has an aggressive approach and good bat-to-ball skills from the left side of the plate, and there's plenty of raw power for him to tap into. Right now, though, Williams makes way too much ground-ball contact -- he's posted ground-ball rates north of 50 percent in every pro season -- so a mechanical adjustment may be necessary to unlock his potential at the plate. The D-backs moved Williams from shortstop, his high school position, to the outfield at the start of his career.

In his abbreviated pro debut last summer, he did what he does best: miss bats and get groundouts. Wong sits at 93-95 mph and reaches 97 mph with his fastball, which features heavy sink when he keeps it down in the strike zone. He switched from throwing a slider in 2017 to using a curveball in 2018, and its power and depth give it the makings of a potential plus offering. His changeup has some fading action but can get too firm at times. With Wong's size, strength and sound delivery, he should have the durability to handle a starter's workload over a full pro season.

While the approach is advanced for his age, and he's not afraid to take a walk, Diaz did a better job of being more selectively aggressive last year in his sophomore campaign.\r\n\r\nDiaz has below-average speed but runs the bases well, with scouts praising his instincts and knack for getting good jumps. He has spent most of his professional career at shortstop but profiles as more of a second baseman at the highest level, where his range, speed and arm strength are a cleaner fit. That said, Diaz's value at either middle-infield spot will be tied to his production.\r\n\r\nAfter raking in the Pioneer League, Diaz is ready to make his full-season debut in 2016.

He's tightened his approach at every level, showing more patience and a discerning eye en route to improved strikeout and walk rates.\r\nThough he's an average runner, Diaz has been successful in just 44.4 percent of his stolen base attempts (28-of-63) as a pro and likely will lose a step with physical maturation. He's capable of playing center field in a pinch but is best-suited long term for right field. The Orioles were thrilled with how amenable Diaz was to making improvements upon joining the organization and then during instructional league. With further refinement, he could develop into a middle-of-the-order run producer who hits for both average and power.","label":0},{"name":"jeff brigham","player_id":"656257","report":"Brigham underwent Tommy John surgery during his sophomore year at Washington in July 2012, and he didn't return to the mound until '14.

His stuff is ready to get big league hitters out, starting with a mid-to-upper-90s fastball that gets swings and misses both in and out of the strike zone. When Glasnow returned from an ankle injury in 2015, his feel for his curveball was inconsistent, forcing him to throw his changeup more and helping him improve his third offering. Control has always been his biggest issue, but he's made significant strides in that area. Glasnow has a clean delivery and arm stroke, but at 6-foot-8, there are a lot of long parts, making it hard to consistently be on time to the plate, particularly with that breaking ball.\r\nGlasnow already has swing-and-miss stuff.

He has the chance to have three at least average pitches, with an above-average curve that has a big break to it and an effective fading changeup that he throws with good arm speed.

Suarez has always had a very strong feel for pitching, but had fringy stuff when he first started out. Then, in 2017, everything picked up a notch, starting with a fastball that he threw all year at 90-95 mph. He uses both breaking balls, an average slider and curveball, as well as an outstanding changeup at all points in the count, setting up hitters and keeping them off-balance with aplomb. He keeps his stuff down in the zone and with sink to get groundball outs and the increased velocity and sharpness of it all led to a lot more strikeouts. He's never been one to walk guys and that didn't change even as his stuff got better.  There isn't a huge separation between him and JoJo Romero, who is a few spots ahead on this list.

An All-Star in the Florida State League in 2017, Agrazal's season ended just one start after a promotion to Double-A due to a pectoral strain, though the Pirates saw enough to add him to the 40-man roster during the offseason.\r\n\r\nAt his best, Agrazal fills up the strike zone and gets a ton of ground-ball outs. His power sinker will touch 95-96 at times and sit in the low 90s, which has led to a career 1.48 GO\/AO ratio entering the 2018 season, a rate that rose to 1.80 in 2017. Agrazal doesn't miss a ton of bats, but he never hurts himself with walks as evidenced by his 1.3 BB\/9 ratio in the Minors. He has a decent feel for a changeup and can spin a breaking ball, though they typically grade out as fringe-average secondary offerings. \r\n\r\nJust 23 for all of 2018, Agrazal has time to refine his secondary stuff, which could allow him to develop into a No. 4 or 5 starter in time. His efficiency on the mound thanks to his strike-throwing ability and getting ground balls early in counts should allow him to eat up innings.

He won Most Valuable Pitcher honors at the Junior College World Series, helping the Indians capture their second national title and then signing for $826,500 as a supplemental second-round choice.\r\nSteele's 6-foot-5 frame and low three-quarters delivery allow him to make lefties uncomfortable and get in on the hands of righties. He throws sinking two-seam fastballs in the low 90s and running four-seamers that can reach 95, both of which play up because of the difficult angle his size and arm slot create. His sweeping slider and changeup show flashes of becoming solid secondary offerings but still lack consistency.\r\nThough he generally throws strikes, Steele will need to improve his command to remain a starter in pro ball. He missed a month during the spring with a blood clot and worked a combined 52 innings in two college seasons, so he'll need to establish he can hold up over a full pro season.

The Yankees took him in the second round and signed him away from an Arizona commitment for $2,497,500, the equivalent of late first-round money. Sauer's fastball now parks at 91-95 mph and could continue to add velocity, and he uses his size and three-quarters delivery to create run and angle. His best secondary pitch is a mid-80s slider with bite, and he also has some power to a curveball that can be solid at its best. He doesn't have much experience throwing a changeup but his has a chance to become an average offering. While there's no question about Sauer's stuff, there are concerns about his delivery.

His best attribute is probably his power, as he tied Swanson and Zander Wiel for the Vanderbilt lead with 15 homers this spring after going homerless in 2014. Wiseman has to let his power come naturally, because his left-handed swing gets long and he struggles to make contact when he aims for the fences.\r\nWith average speed and a fringy arm, Wiseman probably fits best in left field despite playing right field in college and in his introduction to pro ball.

Stewart's patient approach and strong on-base skills have long been strengths, and he continues to offer value on the basepaths with his average speed.  While Stewart's speed and athleticism are better than his stocky build might suggest, he's already been relegated to left field on account of his fringy glove and below-average arm.

He pitched well in his first full season, recording nearly 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings at Class A Lansing before finishing the year at Class A Advanced Dunedin. In 2016, Reid-Foley dominated at both levels as part of a breakout campaign before being shut down in August with a balky right elbow. He's been fully healthy in 2017, making every start for New Hampshire in his first season in Double-A. \r\nReid-Foley's fastball can reach 97 mph, but typically sits at 92-95 mph with arm-side run that helps him miss bats and generate weak, ground-ball contact. Both his slider and his curveball, a pitch he picked up in 2016, have above-average potential, with the latter slightly ahead of the former, and his changeup, once fully developed, could give him a fourth average-or-better offering. Reid-Foley's deceptive delivery and arm action make him particularly tough on right-handed hitters.\r\nMuch of Reid-Foley's success in 2016 can be attributed to his improvement as a strike-thrower, as he trimmed his walks-per-nine rate to 3.0 from 6.3 in his full-season debut. The Blue Jays love his competitive and overall mound presence and believe the physicality, stuff and feel for pitching will give him a chance to be a mid-rotation starter.","label":1},{"name":"eugenio suarez","player_id":"553993","report":"While he faded a bit at the end, Suarez\u2019s first taste of full-season ball can be qualified as nothing more than a huge success.

Concerns about his ability to hit with wood and lack of athleticism dropped him to the Astros with the 28th pick last June, though he performed well in his pro debut and reached Class A Advanced after signing for $2.25 million.\r\nBeer was the most polarizing player in the 2018 Draft. His proponents loved his strength and plate discipline, while his critics didn't like his less-than-smooth left-handed stroke or his persistent struggles with wood bats on the high school showcase circuit and with the U.S. collegiate national team. Houston made some mechanical tweaks to his swing in hopes of enhancing his plate coverage and power, and they worked well in his introduction to pro ball before he got overly aggressive in Class A Advanced.\r\nWhile Beer set national records in the 50- and 100-meter backstroke as an 11- and 12-year-old, he's a limited athlete whose value will come almost solely from his bat. The Astros are trying to help him improve his quickness, but he's a bottom-of-the-scale runner with fringy arm strength.

Cartaya draws repeated Salvador Perez comparisons because of his large frame, defensive ability and strong makeup. He moves well for a tall guy behind the plate and demonstrates advanced receiving skills for his age. He has the arm strength and accuracy to keep the running game in check. One way in which he differs from Perez is that Cartaya's hitting stands out more than his power. He understands the strike zone and recognizes pitches better than most teenagers, and he shows a willingness to use the opposite field.

He fared better and showed crisper stuff while repeating Triple-A this season and then pitched in the Arizona Fall League before joining the Blue Jays in mid-November in exchange for Aledmys Diaz. Thornton added a couple ticks of velocity to his fastball in 2018, working at 93-95 mph and topping out at 97 with riding action.

His slider has morphed into a true cutter that he throws with sharp glove-side slicing action and a bit of sink at 88-92 mph. He needs to refine and trust his changeup more to find success against left-handers, however. Thornton has a funky delivery, but it gives him deception and doesn't prevent him from filling the strike zone.

He had a promising full-season debut in 2017 with Class A Delmarva, posting a .712 OPS with 42 extra-base hits and 20 steals, and continued to build on that performance in '18 with a superb first half in the Class A Advanced Carolina League -- he ranked among the circuit leaders in most offensive categories -- that earned him his first Double-A promotion in June.\r\nMcKenna has good feel to hit, with a line-drive approach that produces quality contact from line to line. He has sneaky pop for his size, too, and some evaluators believe some of McKenna's doubles will eventually translate to more home runs. His overall approach is solid, albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. McKenna has very good speed from the right side of the plate and is a threat on the basepaths. That speed also gives him the chance to stay in center field, and he has more than enough arm strength for the position. \r\nAs with many high schoolers from cold-weather states, patience will be key with McKenna.

The A's took notice of Nottingham's performance and made him their key return in the July trade that sent Scott Kazmir to Houston. Nottingham wasn't with the A's for long, though, as they traded him to Milwaukee during the offseason in the Khris Davis deal.\r\nNottingham's calling card will always be his power. The right-handed hitter's combination of strength and bat speed yields effortless raw power, and he keeps his barrel in the zone long enough to drive the ball out of the park the other way. Nottingham's approach and plate discipline should continue to improve as he gains experience against better arms, and he makes enough contact to project for an average hit tool.\r\nScouts are divided on whether Nottingham can remain behind the plate.

The Orioles, after selecting Knight in the third round in June, went $436,800 above slot to sign the right-hander for $1.1 million. Knight may be extremely skinny, listed at 6-foot-3 and 165 pounds, but he has some power to his fastball, which sits at 90-94 mph and peaks at 97. He also has a mid-80s slider that has a high spin rate and qualifies as a plus pitch at its best. He also will mix in an effective changeup and a curveball he can throw for strikes. Knight has a quick arm and generates velocity without much effort in a repeatable delivery that allows him to fill the strike zone. Knight's stuff stands to improve in the professional ranks if he can add weight to his wiry frame. It also would help answer questions about his durability, especially after Arkansas held him out of summer ball for two straight years and limited him in fall practice as a junior.

After matching Bryan Verbitsky (Padres, 2013) as the highest Draft pick (third round) in school history and signing for a slightly over-slot $563,240, he pitched well in low Class A in his brief pro debut. Rooney's fastball plays better than its mediocre 88-93 mph velocity because he creates difficult angle with his 6-foot-5 frame and can spot his heater to both sides of the plate. While most scouting reports rated his low-80s slider ahead of his fading changeup in college, the latter was more effective in his introduction to pro ball and showed signs of becoming a plus pitch. His slider could become a solid offering if he tightens it up. Pitching in the Cape Cod League in the summer of 2017 taught Rooney that he could compete against quality competition without lighting up radar guns, and he took off once he became more aggressive about challenging hitters. His ability to repeat his sound delivery allows him to command his pitches and he's not afraid to work inside.

After showing pedestrian stuff at Cal State Fullerton as a freshman, he looked electric as a reliever in Cape Cod League, where scouts voted him the summer circuit's top prospect. That prompted him to abruptly transfer to a junior college (College of Southern Nevada) so he'd be eligible for the 2015 Draft, in which he went 18th overall.\r\n\r\nSigned for $2,333,800, Bickford generates differences of opinion as to whether he'll be a starter or reliever because his stuff fluctuates. His fastball often hit 96 mph in 2013, parked at 88-92 at Fullerton, touched 98 in the Cape League and sat in the low 90s with sink in junior college. His slider showed signs of becoming a plus pitch on the Cape but lacks consistency.\r\n\r\nBickford still is honing his changeup and learning to trust it.

When the signing period opened on July 2, the Cubs immediately signed him for $1 million. Gallardo already operates with an 89- to 93-mph fastball, and his arm speed and growing frame hint at more velocity in the future. He has life on his heater and commands it well for his age, making it even more effective. His curveball has good shape and could be a plus pitch once it adds more power. Another sign of Gallardo's advanced feel for pitching is his aptitude for throwing a changeup.

Bourque's breaking ball is equally dynamic, thrown in the upper 80s with sharp, downer action that helps him miss bats with ease.\r\nBourque's ability to induce whiffs with both pitches makes his below-average control a lesser issue, but there is some concern over whether hitters will continue to chase his stuff outside of the zone at higher levels.

His curveball also has improved significantly, becoming a legitimate power breaking ball and giving him a second pitch that grades as well above-average when at its best.\r\nPaulino has made strides with his changeup too, and he had no problem regaining his control after Tommy John surgery. He uses his 6-foot-7 frame to create plane and angle and keep his pitches down in the strike zone.

Officially moved from the rotation to the bullpen ahead of the 2017 season, Schultz spent the first three months on the disabled list after suffering a groin injury in his season debut.\r\nSchultz has power stuff that misses bats consistently, a notion supported by his 11.2 strikeouts-per-nine in back-to-back years at the Double- and Triple-A levels, respectively. The right-hander will reach 98-99 mph with his fastball but usually sits in the mid 90s with considerable arm-side run, maintaining his velocity deep into starts. He pairs his heater with a power breaking ball that piles up whiffs with its depth and bite, and he also shows a fading changeup. Despite making strides with his strike-throwing last season, Schultz's control and command, especially when it comes to getting ahead in counts, leave room for improvement. \r\nSchultz has all the ingredients to serve as a late-inning force coming out of the bullpen, allowing him to better utilize his two plus pitches without worry about throwing strikes or working deep into games.","label":1},{"name":"braden shipley","player_id":"640463","report":"Shipley was a two-way player in high school in Oregon and went to Nevada as a shortstop.

Perhaps the best defensive player in the 2017 Draft, the A's put aside concerns about Allen's strength at the plate and gave him a well-above-slot $2 million bonus in the third round of the Draft. His lack of offensive production has added to the worries about his profile, though he did show improvement in the second half of his first full year. Allen certainly did struggle in the first half of 2018, hitting just .198 with a. .513 OPS in the Midwest League before the All-Star break. Some of that is because of the aforementioned lack of strength, though the A's think he can add some to help him stay durable, but much of it can be attributed to Allen having to deal with the loss of a family member in early May. In the second half, Allen corrected a little drift in his swing and started impacting the baseball more, posting a .274 average and .679 OPS after the break. His walk rate went up and his strikeout rate dropped as his pitch recognition improved. He also stopped worrying about trying to lift or drive the ball, understanding that consistent contact and on-base skills, combined with his plus speed, are his ticket.  There's never been any question that Allen's glove will carry him to the big leagues.

His curveball has the makings of an above-average pitch, one thrown in the high 70s with decent depth and shape, although his varying release point compromises the pitch's effectiveness. Baez's changeup is a work in progress, and he'll need to develop it thoroughly to remain a starter.\r\nBaez's inconsistent mechanics and lack of a third pitch make him to difficult to project as a starter long term, though, at age 22, he still has time on his side.

So Philadelphia took him in the eighth round instead, and watched him dominate in the Gulf Coast League. He wasn't bad when he moved up to the short-season New York-Penn League, but he was a bit more inconsistent. Mezquita was limited in 2018 somewhat by some minor injuries, so the hope is a fully healthy version of the left-hander will be ready to take on full-season ball in 2019. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, there is some arm strength and a feel for pitching that should help him along the way. His fastball will sit in the 91-92 mph range, but he can reach back for 94 mph on occasion. He can spin a breaking ball and has feel for his changeup with the chance to have three average or better offerings when all is said and done.

The Nationals picked him in the third round anyway and he made a strong professional debut.  Known mostly for his power before the draft, Ward showed a surprisingly mature hitting approach in his professional debut. Though he was a shortstop in high school, he has already moved to third base.

He reached Double-A for the first time as a 20-year-old in '17, following a strong showing in the Florida State League, and he was having a solid campaign in his return to the Southern League when the Cardinals acquired him as part of the Tommy Pham deal at the 2018 non-waiver Trade Deadline. After finishing the season in Triple-A, Cabrera dominated as a reliever in the Dominican Winter League, posting a 0.63 WHIP with 21 strikeouts in 14 1\/3 innings for Tigres del Licey. Cabrera has added strength to his wiry frame and had his stuff tick up as a result. The left-hander generates easy velocity with his quick arm, sitting in the mid 90s and bumping 98 mph with his fastball. His slider registers in the upper 80s, thrown with late, short slicing action that gives it a cutter-like feel at times, and he also throws a changeup that is effective against right-handed hitters. His curveball is below average and represents a distant fourth pitch. Though his stuff can be electric, Cabrera struggles to throw strikes at times because he has a violent delivery that makes his over-the-top arm slot difficult to repeat. Whether Cabrera can refine his delivery enough to improve his control -- 4.6 BB\/9 in 2018; 3.7 BB\/9 in his career -- will determine if he remains a starter. The Cardinals will continue to develop him in that role, but as a lefty with a big fastball and a swing-and-miss breaking ball, Cabrera's appeal as a potential bullpen asset is undeniable.","label":0},{"name":"brandon miller","player_id":"669732","report":"It can sometimes be difficult for a Division II player to get noticed.

One of 10 finalists for the Brett Tomko Award, presented annually to the nation's top Division II pitcher, Miller signed for $250,000 after the Mariners selected him in the sixth round.\r\nMiller is all about command, one who walked just 13 and struck out 115 in 107 2\/3 innings during his regular season last spring. The right-hander's fastball sits right around 90 mph but plays up thanks to his ability to move it to all quadrants of the zone. His slider is his best offering, thrown with short, late biting action, though it's not a huge strikeout pitch for him. His fringy curve is used more as a get-me-over pitch for strike one or as a chase pitch out of the zone with two strikes. He has feel for a changeup, but doesn't use it much.\r\nWhile Miller has outstanding arm action and repeats his delivery well, a general lack of movement has some thinking he might end up in long relief.

After two summers in the Gulf Coast League, he took a nice step forward while pitching full-season ball for the first time. Balazovic made very good strides during extended Spring Training and that carried over into his 2018 Midwest League debut. The big right-hander had plenty left in the tank at the end of the year, living in the 92-94 mph range and consistently up to 95 mph with his fastball. He throws it with good sinking action to get groundball outs. His changeup has improved quite a bit and while he can still throw it a bit too hard, in the 85-86 mph range, it has more movement and because of his uptick in velocity, there's more separation between the two pitches. The slider is still his go-to breaking ball and it flashes plus at times. There could still be more in the tank as Balazovic continues to fill out his 6-foot-4 frame, giving him considerable ceiling.

Filia returned to the Bruins in 2016 and then signed for $1,000 as a 20th-round pick at age 24, making him one of the oldest players in the 2016 Draft. After excelling in his first full season in the Class A Advanced California League and then again in the Arizona Fall League, Filia was suspended for the first 50 games of the 2018 season following his second positive test for a drug of abuse in January. The Red Sox acquired him in June as the player to be named in the trade that sent Roenis Elias to the Mariners in April, only to return him to Seattle several days later and instead settle for cash considerations to complete the trade. Filia has one of the more advanced approaches among Minor League hitters, with outstanding pitch and zone recognition, plus bat-to-ball skills and innate feel to hit from line to line.

The latter led Houston farmhands with a 2.23 ERA and advanced to Double-A 12 months after signing. Bielak lacks a true plus pitch but has the potential for four solid offerings. His 91-94 mph four-seam fastball has high spin rates that give it riding life that helps it dodge bats up in the strike zone.

When the Draft arrived, concerns about Liberatore's signability caused the Arizona commit to last until the mid-first round, where the Rays were thrilled to find him still available at the No. 16 overall pick. He signed for slightly below slot at $3,497,500, helping Tampa Bay save the money needed to sign fellow first-rounders Shane McClanahan and Nick Schnell, and he performed well during his pro debut at a pair of Rookie levels.\r\nA 6-foot-5 left-hander, Liberatore stands out for his combination of stuff and pitchability, with the makings of three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale once fully developed. He sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph with a fastball that plays above its velocity because he's deceptive and gets such good extension over his front side. Liberatore's curveball is a swing-and-miss hammer, thrown with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate, and he introduced a new, and very effective, slider during the spring. His diving changeup, meanwhile, is another promising pitch, one that plays nicely off his heater and could be his best secondary offering when all is said and done.\r\nAfter ranking as the top left-hander in his class and garnering consideration as a top-five overall pick, Liberatore now could end up as one of the 2018 Draft's biggest steals. While he's more advanced than most high school arms in his class and therefore could move comparatively faster than some of his peers, the Rays likely will bring Liberatore along slowly, as they usually do with their high school Draft picks, giving him the time he needs to develop physically and refine his craft.","label":0},{"name":"nolan jones","player_id":"666134","report":"Jones took to hockey before baseball and showed promise as a center before concussion issues caused him to focus on the diamond.

Gettys fared much better in his return to Fort Wayne in 2016, however, earning mid-season All-Star honors in the Midwest League before moving up to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in late June. \r\nGettys' bat speed, foot speed, arm strength and defensive ability all grade as well above average. He's an outstanding defender in center field, where he gets great jumps, uses his double-plus speed to cover a ton of ground and shows a ridiculously strong arm. Gettys' swing is just as explosive and gives him plus raw power, but he's been unable to make consistent contact as a pro, let alone apply it consistently in games. Meanwhile, strikeouts will continue to be a problem for the young outfielder until he improves his pitch recognition and strike-zone management.\r\nGettys' frustration showed at times last season, but the Padres felt he did a good job separating his defense from his struggles at the plate.

Lean and wiry, he has a good feel for three pitches, all of which he is capable of throwing for strikes. There's the chance he could add weight and strength to his frame, which would allow him to add velocity to his 91- to 92-mph fastball. His best pitch is his plus changeup and he does have a solid breaking ball, though he did hang them up in the zone on occasion. The Braves were being very cautious with Beck, given that he threw over 90 innings at Stanford a year after not pitching, so it will be 2019 before Braves fans get a real look at the pitcher the Braves scouting department was going to take instead of Mike Soroka had he been signable out of high school.","label":0},{"name":"michael kopech","player_id":"656629","report":"Before the Red Sox selected Kopech 33rd overall in June, they hadn't drafted a high school right-hander in the first round since Josh Garrett in 1996.

Some of that is tied to pitchers being able to exploit his aggressive approach, though he did make gains in that regard in 2017 by improving both his strikeout and walk rates. Yet, those adjustments haven't stopped evaluators from questioning the future utility of his offensive profile. \r\nNottingham's stagnation at the plate hasn't kept him from making significant strides behind it, though, and club officials were very impressed with his improved catch-and-throw skills and overall progress as a blocker and receiver in 2017, when he threw out 40 percent of attempted basestealers in the Southern League.

Challenged by the Nationals with a full-season assignment at age 18 in 2018, he made relatively quick work of the Class A South Atlantic League and then performed well as the Carolina League's youngest player after a July promotion. Along the way, Garcia suited up for the World team as the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game's youngest player. Garcia has a knack for making good contact across the entire field using a quick, hands-y swing from the left side of the plate. His hand-eye coordination and feel for the barrel translate to plus bat-to-ball skills, and it's easy to envision Garcia hitting for more power as he continues to add strength and understand his swing. He's lost a step since signing, but still has at least above-average speed and is lauded as a smart baserunner. A sure-handed shortstop with quick feet and clean actions, Garcia anticipates well and has enough range to make all the routine plays, with plus arm strength that's a fit anywhere on the infield. His remaining physical projection leads some scouts to believe he's best suited long term for second base, and he saw time both there and at the hot corner in 2018.

If he keeps that up, he\u2019ll be known for much more than his Draft night back flip. Hawkins can turn on any fastball and has at least above-average raw power to all fields. With the power comes a lot of swing and miss and he will have to refine his approach at the plate to have continued success and be a better all-around hitter. His above-average speed works well on the basepaths and in center field for now, though he may end up getting pushed to a corner as he matures.

In the fall, Abreu won the Nats' strength and conditioning competition during instructional league. Improved plate discipline was key to Abreu's maturation as a hitter last season, as he did a better job controlling the strike zone and did so without suppressing his emerging power. But Abreu hasn't been able to build on that performance this season at Class A Potomac, where he has struggled to consistently drive the ball while experiencing an uptick in his strikeout rate. A plus runner, Abreu is still learning to translate his speed into basestealing success.

After a solid start to Banda's season between Triple-A and the Majors, it was announced in early June that the lefty would require Tommy John surgery. Banda had trouble finding a rhythm during the 2017 season as he rode the Reno-Arizona shuttle at times, often getting thrown from his routine. That did not help him learn to deal with the struggles he faced, both in the tough pitching environment of Reno and in the big leagues. There's still a lot to like about Banda's stuff, though, starting with a fastball that was up to 97 mph pitching in relief at the end of the year. He could settle into the 93-95 mph range when all is said and done. His curveball flashes plus, but it was inconsistent at times last year, and he has good enough feel for his changeup to envision it eventually being consistently average.

The left-hander's velocity ticked up in 2016, as he sat at 92-94 mph, touching 96, after pitching with an average fastball as an amateur. What's more, Peters throws the pitch with good sinking action and maintains his velocity deep into starts. Peters' tight, 76-80 mph curveball grades as above average and is effective against right- and left-handed hitters alike, and he also can get outs with his deceptive circle changeup, an average pitch that he masks nicely with fastball-like arm action.\r\nPeters' arsenal plays up because of his ability to command his pitches to either side of the plate and work down in the strike zone, especially with his heater.

After a strong turn with the U.S. national collegiate team last summer, there was excitement about his junior season, but it ended early when he blew out his elbow in February and needed Tommy John surgery. The Cardinals decided it was worth the risk to take Gingery and let him rehab with their staff, signing him in the fourth round for an above-pick-value bonus of $825,000. Gingery's velocity on his fastball is fringy, sitting at 88-92 mph and occasionally touching 94, but it plays up because it has good sink and he can command it to both sides of the plate. It's also helped by his best pitch, a plus fading changeup that was among the best in the 2018 Draft class. Gingery has an average curveball as well, one that he throws for strikes consistently. Gingery's ceiling is somewhat limited to that of a back-end starter. At the same time, he does have a fairly high floor as a pitchability lefty who can eat a lot of innings and is a plus competitor.

But Tarnok took a big step forward by pitching well in full-season ball last summer. The more the Braves see Tarnok, the more confidence they have in his ability to pitch at the highest level and withstand the rigors of a long season, with the chance to be a starter. He's starting to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame, which should help him maintain his stuff deep into starts. He tops out at 96 mph and should settle in at 93-94 mph, a pitch that plays up because of his excellent extension and finish.

Playing against considerably older competition, he produced a .351\/.418\/.587 line with 11 home runs in 61 games and led the circuit with 85 hits and 57 RBIs. Franco's robust production during his pro debut reflects his high offensive ceiling. He consistently impacts the baseball from both sides of the plate, showing a combination of bat speed, strong wrists\/hands and elite bat-to-ball skills that leads some scouts to project him as a plus-plus hitter.

Though he was banged up, he had a strong pro debut in the New York-Penn League and was holding his own during his full-season debut in the California League until a sprained elbow shelved him in June. Merrell should be able to use his legs to wreak havoc on the basepaths. He's still learning his left-handed swing and he had a tendency to hook balls on the ground early on. He's now working on getting some separation so he can impact the ball, and he's learning to slash the ball to the left side so he can use his legs to help him more. The combination of approach and speed could make him an above-average hitter, albeit one with little power, in time. It's unclear what Merrell's long-term defensive home will be. He's unorthodox defensively at short, with a fringy arm, but he does have impressive range. He impressed in big league camp during 2018 Spring Training, playing on both sides of second base. He also played some outfield in college. It could be that Merrell ends up fitting a super-utility role at the big league level, with his speed playing at a number of positions, though it's too early to rule out an every day gig at second base. Most importantly, he needs to make up for lost at-bats in 2019.","label":0},{"name":"hunter cole","player_id":"607500","report":"Cole had the offensive ability to go in the top 10 rounds of the 2014 Draft, but he fell to the 26th round because teams worried about his signability.

He hit his way to Double-A in his first full pro season while also seeing his first extensive action at second base.\r\nCole has the bat speed and strength to produce for both average and power. To do so, he'll need to guard against his right-handed swing becoming too long and improve his strike-zone discipline and his ability to handle quality breaking pitches. He tends to hit the ball up the middle and to right-center, and the Giants would like to see him pull more pitches so he can turn his plus raw power into more home runs.\r\nAn outfielder in his first two years at Georgia and a third baseman as a junior, Cole began 2015 playing second base full-time in low Class A and continued to work there in high Class A. He only played right field in Double-A and while he could fill in as an infielder if he gets to the big leagues, he's going to be more of a corner outfielder than a super-utilityman.

He finished the season with 21 home runs and 27 stolen bases over 122 games between the two levels, and then firmly put himself on the Major League radar with a standout campaign in the Arizona Fall League. Harrison's breakout caught the attention of the Marlins, and they acquired him with Lewis Brinson, Isan Diaz and Jordan Yamamoto for Christian Yelich in January.\r\nHarrison might have the loudest tools in Miami's system. He generates plus raw power to all fields thanks to a combination of physical strength and plus bat speed that enables him to turn around velocity. That power does come with some strikeout concerns, as Harrison's swing will get too long at times and he'll struggle to recognize spin, causing him to expand his zone. Harrison's plus speed makes him a basestealing threat as well as an above-average defender, either in center field or in right, where his cannon for an arm is a clean fit.\r\nHarrison offered a taste of his potential during his breakout 2017 campaign, and the Marlins are justifiably excited about what the future may hold for their new outfielder.

But for as good as his swing-and-miss stuff may be, Schultz's strike-throwing issues remain a problem. That being said, he has cut down on the free passes this year at Triple-A Durham,\r\nThe Rays continue to develop Schultz as a starter, but his 5-foot-10, 200-pound frame and control problems have some believing he's destined for the bullpen, where he could see an uptick in velocity and serve as an effective short reliever.","label":1},{"name":"casey mize","player_id":"663554","report":"Undrafted out of high school, Mize honored his commitment to Auburn and blossomed into one of the top college pitchers in the nation. His combination of stuff and control improved in each of his three years there, and he became the highest drafted player in program history when Detroit made him the No. 1 overall pick and signed him for $7.5 million, a record in the bonus pool era. A lengthy junior campaign during which Mize accrued 114 2\/3 innings prompted the Tigers to limit his workload after signing, though it certainly didn't keep the right-hander from having an impressive pro debut that concluded with four abbreviated starts in the Florida State League.  With plus command and the ability to induce whiffs with three different pitches, Mize has the ingredients needed to headline a starting rotation. A plus-plus splitter in the mid-80s that dives at the plate is his best offering, and he's adept at locating the pitch down in the zone or below it. Mize sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider took a step forward as a junior, consistently grading as a plus offering, and he also has developed the ability to manipulate it into a harder cutter when he desires. Mize has long shown a knack for pounding the zone and attacking hitters. He finished first in NCAA Division I in K\/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posted similar numbers as a junior while finishing third among D-I hurlers with 156 strikeouts. That Mize was shut down in 2017 at Auburn and again in the summer with Team USA due to a tired arm and flexor strain in his forearm raises concerns about his durability. However, he did his part by staying healthy throughout his 2018 campaign, and neither his athletic frame nor his clean delivery have a glaring flaw. With his plus stuff and plus command, it should surprise no one to see him move quickly through the Tigers' system.","label":0},{"name":"alex speas","player_id":"666208","report":"Speas unquestionably had first-round stuff but his difficulty harnessing it helped drop him to the second round of the 2016 Draft.

Texas held him to 8 1\/3 innings in his pro debut, and he showed off both his bat-missing ability and his wildness with 11 strikeouts and seven walks.\r\nIt may seem like blasphemy, but Speas' pure stuff, lanky frame and impressive athleticism earn him comparisons to Dwight Gooden. He pitches at 92-96 mph and reaches 99 with a fastball that explodes on hitters with its riding action, and he could pick up more velocity as he develops physically. He also can overpower hitters with a hard curveball but can't always land it for strikes.\r\nWhile Gooden dominated big leaguers at age 19, Speas is trying to figure things out in short-season ball at the same stage of his career. He has a clean delivery but still is learning to repeat it, and his changeup is still in its rudimentary stages.

He made just two starts in 2018, however, before having surgery to remove a blood clot from his pitching shoulder. Otto's best pitch is a spike curveball that combines power and 12-to-6 break, and it can be well above-average at times and difficult to control at others. He works at 92-95 mph and touches 97 with his fastball, which returned to full strength during instructional league last fall, though it remains to be seen if he can maintain it with a full starter's workload. He had little use for a changeup in college and developing one will be a point of emphasis in 2019. Otto has overwhelmed hitters with pure stuff and never has displayed reliable control or command, so he'll have to be more efficient with his pitches to remain in the rotation. He has a strong build and his arm works well, which should bode well for his durability, though he did miss time as a Rice junior with a tired arm and Owls pitchers have a poor track record of holding up in pro ball.

A move to the bullpen in 2018 has helped.\r\n\r\nThe right-hander began his career throwing in the low-90s, but has since been able to crank it up consistently to the mid-90s and touches 100 mph, especially in shorter relief stints. His fastball can be straight at times, something he'll have to work on as upper-level hitters catch up to his velocity. He'll show a power curveball around 80 mph which can morph into something that looks more like a slider when he doesn't stay on top of it. He does have some feel for a changeup, but it's not as important in a relief role.\r\n\r\nLara does struggle with control and command, though it doesn't need to be pinpoint in relief, and there were questions about his durability due to his frame and funky arm action.

The Braves sent Cruz to full-season Rome to start 2017, and it was a mistake. The teenage switch-hitter was in over his head in the South Atlantic League and got sent back down to the Appy League to try to hit the reset button. He still has solid tools and excellent athleticism, with his plus speed his true carrying tool. At his best, he's shown the ability to make consistent contact and spray line drives all over the field, more consistently from the right side than the left. While he was a shortstop initially, he moved over to second when he went back down to Danville a year ago and that's now his likely full-time home, where he should be a capable defender without his fringy arm causing issues.  It's hard to put pressure on a 19-year-old by saying that it's a big year for him, but the 2018 season could be a huge one for Cruz.

He responded with a strong pro debut, reaching full-season ball, then made it to Double-A in his first full season.\r\n\r\nThaiss has one of the most advanced approaches at the plate of any hitter from his Draft class. He sees pitches and draws walks while keeping strikeouts to a minimum. That should allow him to continue to hit for average and tap into power that should show up more consistently now that he is away from Virginia's cavernous home park. The Angels moved Thaiss to first base upon signing and that's likely his long-term home. While he did play some first at Virginia, he was a bit rough around the bag during his debut, though the Angels are pleased with the progress he's already made with his footwork.\r\n\r\nThaiss is the kind of college bat that should be able to move relatively quickly through a system.

Paddack's success as an amateur carried over to his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he posted a 2.18 ERA and 39\/7 K\/BB ratio in 45 innings. He was off to an outstanding start to his full-season debut in 2016 -- and had not allowed a hit in three straight five-inning outings -- when Miami traded him to San Diego for Fernando Rodney on June 30. He was shut down with a forearm strain less than a month later and underwent Tommy John surgery in August.\r\n \r\nPaddack has an impressive combination of stuff and feel for a high school pitcher. An uptick in velocity in 2015 pushed his fastball into the 92-94 mph range in his pro debut, and he's already adept at locating it to both sides of the plate. Paddack's changeup is borderline double-plus and easily his best secondary offering, thrown with convincing arm action and outstanding tumble. He's also made strides with his breaking ball in 2016, throwing it with greater depth and sharper bite.\r\n \r\nListed at 6-foot-4, 195 pounds, Paddack is just beginning to grow into his highly projectable frame, and some scouts believe he'll operate in the mid 90s at maturity. The right-hander uses his height to create good plane toward the plate, and it's only going to improve as he adds strength and gains better control of his core.

During his 2017 professional debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League, he finished with a .299 average and a .404 on-base percentage, the latter a product of him walking (33) nearly as often as he struck out (36). His impressive debut earned him a promotion to the Class A Midwest League as an 18-year-old in 2018. He didn't disappoint, notching a .368 on-base percentage while showcasing an incredibly advanced plate approach for his age.  Rosario has natural hitting ability thanks to a combination of bat speed, barrel control and hand-eye coordination. He has quick hands and makes lot of hard contact from the left side of the plate, and he could grow into average power. Rosario's above-average speed enables him to cover ground with graceful strides in the outfield, and club officials are optimistic about his chances of remaining in center field. Rosario still needs time to develop in the Minors, mostly to fill out his lean and athletic frame.

He'll throw his fastball in the 89-91 mph range and do a very good job of mixing in his slider and changeup to keep hitters off balance. His command suffered as a junior, partially because of pitch selection and partially because of a blister issue that has bothered him on and off throughout his college career. \r\n\r\nThere is some projection to Waddell and his 6-foot-3 frame.

He began the year throwing his fastball in the 90-92 mph range, but he was sitting 90-95 by the end of the summer. He throws a true 11-to-5 curve with good depth to it, though he commanded it inconsistently. His changeup is underdeveloped -- he was mostly a fastball-curveball pitcher in '16 -- but he can throw it with good arm speed, and it has the chance to be average once he starts using it more, something he'll have to do as he reaches the upper levels.\r\nCommand and feel often come back a little slower with pitchers returning from TJ surgery, but the Phillies saw enough to add him to the 40-man roster this past offseason.

His changeup is his best secondary pitch and receives solid-average grades from evaluators, who note that the right-hander throws the pitch with confidence. Peralta's breaking ball and control are both well below average and will be focal points in his development in 2017. \r\nThe Orioles have helped Peralta simplify his delivery in the past year, but scouts still question whether his wiry frame will be able to handle the rigors of a full regular-season workload.

He had an uneven first season of pro ball in 2017, but the Reds feel it created a foundation upon which the right-hander can build.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Gutierrez hadn't pitched competitively in about two years and that he was shut down in August because of fatigue, his peripherals were pretty solid. He showed he can fill up the strike zone (1.7 BB\/9) and miss a fair amount of bats (8.2 K\/9) at the same time. He does it with a three-pitch mix that gives him a good chance to start. His fastball touches as high as 97-98 mph, but wasn't consistent, more frequently sitting in the low 90s in 2017. He adds and subtracts from his plus curveball without losing bite to it, throwing it for strikes at times and bouncing it as a chase pitch at others. He has feel for a changeup that should be average in time.\r\n\r\nNow with that experience under his belt, the Reds feel 2018 will be a true evaluation of who Gutierrez is.

He's a solid defender with good range and an arm that grades out as a tick-above average. At the plate, he consistently barrels up balls with good power, especially given his size. He should grow into more over-the-fence power as he matures, while his baserunning acumen will allow him to pick up extra bases when he hits the gaps. He's not a burner, but he's very aggressive on the basepaths and likes to steal bases.\r\n \r\nDowns gets high marks for his effort and brings a good amount of self-confidence to the field.

That size translates to premium velocity, as he'll consistently sit in the mid-to-upper 90s and flirt with triple digits, all while working on a steep downhill plane to both sides of the plate. Baez has a hard slider that pairs nicely with his heater, flashing above-average potential with two-plane action, and he's impressed scouts with his feel for a changeup early in his career.\r\nGiven Baez's sheer size, learning to consistently repeat his delivery will be key in his development as a starter. If he can learn to do so while also refining his secondaries and command, the big right-hander could become a mid-rotation starter, if not more. At the least, Baez's robust fastball and promising secondaries point to a bright future at the back end of a big league bullpen.","label":0},{"name":"david peterson","player_id":"656849","report":"Peterson was a prospect coming from the Colorado high school powerhouse Regis Jesuit, but he opted to head to Oregon instead.

He made a brief pro debut in the short-season New York-Penn League. Working with pitching coach Jason Dietrich at Oregon, Peterson struck out better than 12.5 per nine and walked just 1.35 per nine as a junior and brings a solid repertoire and that plus control to the pro game. From a velocity standpoint, Peterson's fastball is average, sitting in the low 90s and occasionally touching 95 mpg. But it plays up thanks to its plus sink and his ability to command it. He combines it with a slider that is plus at times and serves as an out pitch and has a changeup that flashes above-average that could be a good weapon against right-handers. He's mixed in a fringy curve for strike one at times in the past. Despite a lower arm slot, Peterson has shown he has outstanding control of all his pitches, even if he can stand to refine his overall command some.

He originally signed with the Astros for a $5.15 million bonus (and a matching overage tax penalty) in September 2016, but the deal was voided a month later, reportedly due to concerns about his physical. He agreed to a $2 million bonus in December, with Houston having to equal that amount in overage tax.\r\nThough he's not very physical, Perez has a quick arm and an intriguing fastball. He sat around 90 mph in Cuba but has thrown harder since defecting, now operating in the low 90s and reaching 95. Even if he doesn't get much taller, there's plenty of room to add strength to his 5-foot-11 frame, which means there should be more velocity in his tank.\r\nPerez shows some feel for spinning the ball, and while he uses both a curveball and slider that sometimes blend together, he has the making of a solid breaking ball in the future.

Because the Phillies saved money on signing Mickey Moniak, they were able to give Gowdy $3.5 million to sign.\r\nGowdy didn't throw much during his pro debut last summer and was initially set back by biceps tendinitis before Tommy John surgery ended his 2017 season in mid-August. But the Phillies realized they didn't have to do much with his sound and clean delivery. He uses those polished mechanics to offer up a solid three-pitch mix, with some upside to come. He throws his fastball in the 90-93 mph range consistently, and with his 6-foot-4 frame looking like it could take on more strength, there could be extra velocity in the future. Gowdy calls his breaking ball a curve, but it's more of a hybrid, and some within the organization feel it will eventually develop into an above-average slider. Gowdy has good feel for his changeup, giving him at least a third Major League average offering.

Taken with no expectations as a 39th-round senior sign, Walsh focused on his bat for much of his pro career. Playing mostly first base and a little outfield, he'd always hit well, then broke out across three levels and led the organization in RBIs and finished tied for the lead in home runs. At the same time, he started re-introducing pitching to his resume, showing some aptitude as a lefty reliever. Walsh's raw power from the left side has always been intriguing and he started tapping into it consistently in 2018. There were plenty of strikeouts, but also a much higher walk rate, and that improved approach helped him get more pitches to drive. Defensively, he probably is a first baseman only, but it's the bat that gives him a chance to hit in the big leagues. It's hard to evaluate what kind of pitcher Walsh is. Without any real instruction or program, he was touching 93 mph with his fastball and could spin an occasional plus breaking ball.

Romero looked more like a pure pitchability lefty coming out of Yavapai, but his improved stuff, along with his command, make him a much better pitching prospect overall. His four-seam fastball was up to 95 mph all year, including his final start of 2017 against Blue Jays super-prospects Vladimir Guerrero Jr and Bo Bichette, while his sinking 90-93 mph two-seamer generates a lot of weak contact on the ground. Depending on the report, he has as many as four secondary pitches. His changeup and cutter have the chance to be plus pitches, while he has a distinct average slider that is a bit ahead of his curveball. He fills the strike zone with all of them consistently.

His 88-93 mph four-seam fastball plays above its velocity because he can locate it with precision. His fading changeup improved in 2016 and might represent his best chance for a plus offering, and his curveball has some downer action if not a ton of power behind it.\r\nBoston's 2016 Minor League pitcher of the year isn't physical and may be more skinny than projectable, so his floor stands out more than his ceiling.

Upon joining the Orioles system, Bannon was promoted to Double-A and shifted from the hot corner to second base.  Bannon's compact frame is loaded with strength, and he knows how to get the most out of it at the plate. A 5-foot-10 right-handed hitter, he sets up with an open stance, then utilizes a big leg kick and upper-cut bat path to generate above-average raw power. It's a unique swing with a lot of moving parts, but Bannon controls it well, consistently getting the bat head through the zone. Of course, such a swing also comes with some swing-and-miss concerns and pull-side tendencies, both of which were exposed a bit during Bannon's time in Double-A.  Bannon saw time at both second and third base in the Dodgers system, then played second almost exclusively after the trade. His average speed, actions and arm strength all profile better at the keystone, though it's a bat-first profile regardless of where he lands on the defense spectrum. If it all clicks, Bannon could develop into a valuable utility player at the highest level.","label":0},{"name":"miguel sano","player_id":"593934","report":"Sano has been in the spotlight since signing out of the Dominican Republic in 2009.

He can hit the ball out of any park to all fields, and while he swings and misses a good amount, he improved his plate discipline and is drawing more walks. His defense is a bigger question mark. Sano is a big young man, but he is fairly agile and does have the tools -- particularly a plus arm -- to stay there. He will need, however, to improve his footwork and focus in order to do so. Sano turns just 20 in 2013, so there's no reason to rush him, with the payoff being a very special run producer at the hot corner.\r\n\r\nBernie Pleskoff's scouting report \u00bb","label":1},{"name":"jake burger","player_id":"669394","report":"Burger slammed 21 homers (second in NCAA Division I) as a Missouri State sophomore in 2016 and 22 as the Missouri Valley Conference's player of the year in 2017, helping him become the first position player in school history ever selected in the first round. Signed for $3.7 million as the 13th overall choice, he missed all of last season after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while running out a grounder in February and tearing it again while rehabbing in May. The injuries cost him a year of development but shouldn't affect his long-term projection. Burger has the strength and solid bat speed to provide 25 or more homers on an annual basis, and he was working on making adjustments to hit more balls in the air after a ground ball-heavy debut. As a stocky right-handed slugger with some arm bar in his stroke, he has drawn comparisons to former Chicago third baseman Todd Frazier. He has a patient approach and a penchant for making contact, so he should be a better hitter than Frazier. While Burger can look more awkward than graceful, he's a deceptive athlete who gets the job done in all phases of the game. Before he got hurt, he displayed average speed out of the batter's box and was even quicker underway.

The Terrapins' all-time leader in victories (30) and whiffs (307), he looked more like his sophomore self during his brief pro debut, fanning 22 in 15 2\/3 innings at short-season Lowell.\r\nShawaryn has a solid three-pitch repertoire and generates good life on his offerings from a low three-quarters arm slot. His fastball usually runs from 90-94 mph, though it dipped as low as 86-88 mph early last spring. His sweeping slider might be his best offering, missing bats against both lefties and righties, and he also has feel for a deceptive changeup with fade.\r\nThere's some debate as to whether Shawaryn will remain a starter in the long term. Helping his cause, he throws a lot of strikes and has a strong, durable build that allows him to maintain his stuff into the late innings and over the course of the season. But some scouts don't like his arm slot and the effort in his delivery, and his fastball and slider could become plus pitches in shorter stints.","label":0},{"name":"yandy diaz","player_id":"650490","report":"In his two-plus seasons since signing for $300,000 as a Cuban defector, Diaz has proven to be one of the best and most disciplined hitters in the Indians' system.

He finished the year in Triple-A and gained even more valuable experience in the Arizona Fall League before returning to Columbus for the 2016 season. \r\nDiaz is a truly disciplined hitter who never ties to do too much and rarely expands his zone. He makes a lot of contact with his compact right-handed swing, while his flat path through the zone produces line drives across the whole field. The drawback to Diaz' mature approach is that it keeps him from tapping into his raw power, as he's accrued just 41 extra-base hits through his first 212 pro games. The Indians believe the power will come once he learns to drive the ball, although some scouts question whether he has the necessary bat speed to generate useable pop in games. \r\nPrimarily second baseman in Cuba, Diaz has since developed into an above-average defender at third base, where his range, soft hands and strong arm are all clean fits. He's also seen quite a bit of time in the outfield lately to increase his versatility, and it wouldn't be a surprise if Diaz were to serve as a backup at both positions for the Indians during the final stretch of the season.","label":1},{"name":"jordan paroubeck","player_id":"641952","report":"Paroubeck attended Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, Calif., the alma mater of Barry Bonds.

He makes consistent contact and rarely strikes out, carrying a career .323 average in the Minors when he got called up to the big leagues for the first time in August. His ability to hit for average is really his lone offensive tool, as he doesn't possess over-the-fence power, and speed isn't a big part of his game. But along with his bat, he does offer positional flexibility, showing the ability to play second, short and third base capably.\r\n\r\nAll of this points to a potential big league career as a utility guy.

He'll sit comfortably in the low-90s and touch the mid-90s on occasion, thrown with good life. His secondary stuff still needs some work, but he has improved in that area as well. He does show a feel to spin a breaking ball and will flash an above-average one from time to time. It will vary from curveball to slider shape. He does have a changeup that has the chance to eventually become an average offering. Soto's biggest issue has been with his command. He cut his walk rate considerably in the New York-Penn League in 2016, but he still carried a 5.7 BB\/9 ratio into the 2017 season.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that Soto keeps improving his overall pitchability as he continues to move forward.

He led the Minors with 82 steals in 2015 and tied for third with 52 in '17 to push his career total to 234 stolen bases in his first six pro seasons. Mateo's wheels are equally dynamic out of the box, as he regularly turns in top-of-the-scale run times from home to first. His deceptive strength translates to sneaky raw power and he has an offensive ceiling of a .275 hitter with 15 homers per season, though he'll need to tighten his plate discipline to become a quality leadoff man.\r\nMateo has the raw tools to stick at shortstop, most notably outstanding range and plus arm strength, though his consistency and focus in the field still leave something to be desired.

First, he missed time with a bout of vertigo in May and then came a fractured right index finger that required season-ending surgery in June. Bone spurs in his elbow cut short his fall work as well. But there was a lot to like in the short amount of time that Senzel did play.\r\n\r\nSenzel is an athletic player whose bat is just about ready for the highest level. That's not surprising given he was billed as the top pure hitter in his Draft class. Originally a third baseman out of Tennessee, he can handle the hot corner and he also has the makings of an above-average second baseman. He got some reps in center and left field during instructs as the Reds continue to look for ways to get his bat into the big league lineup soon, as he is blocked at second and third. \r\n\r\nWhen healthy, Senzel uses a combination of strength and bat speed, along with an advanced approach at the plate, to be an extremely dangerous hitter from the right side. He makes consistent hard contact, doesn't strike out a lot and draws walks, which points to a future of hitting over .300 and perhaps competing for batting titles. He could debut as an everyday utility player until a permanent spot opens for him.","label":1},{"name":"spencer turnbull","player_id":"605513","report":"At Alabama, Turnbull sliced his ERA from 5.60 as a freshman to 3.70 as a sophomore to 2.22 as a junior this spring.

The life on his fastball also has gotten better, and he uses his size and high-three-quarters delivery to throw it on a downhill plane. His slider has taken a step forward as well and shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. \r\nWith the makings of an average changeup and a strong build, Turnbull projects as a possible mid-rotation starter.

While productive, he's also had a string of scary injuries: a hairline fracture and ligament\/muscle damang in his left arm in 2017, then a broken fibula and torn ankle ligaments in his left leg this past spring. The Cardinals liked Baker's power potential enough to take him No. 75 overall, and he returned to health and reached full-season ball quickly during his pro debut.  Baker has tremendous strength and leverage thanks to his 6-foot-4, 265-pound frame. Coupled with good bat speed, he has legitimate power to all fields. Yes, there's length to Baker's right-handed swing, but he displays solid control of his swing and walked more than he struck out during his TCU career, rarely expanding the zone when he was pitched around.  A solid athlete for his size, Baker is nonetheless limited as a runner and defender. He does have a plus arm that once delivered low-90s fastballs, but he is decidedly a first baseman only.

He's physically strong, with an athletic and repeatable delivery that gives him present command of a fastball that sits at 91-93 mph and has reached 96. He complements his fastball with both a knuckle-changeup and a standard changeup, both grading as above average, and evaluators expect his curveball to earn a similar grade once he can better repeat his arm slot. Morejon understands sequencing and throws strikes with his entire arsenal, and he should continue to make gains in velocity and command as he matures physically.\r\nMorejon's delivery requires some cleaning up and he faces some concerns about his durability, but there are some evaluators who believe that the final product could be that of a frontline starter.","label":0},{"name":"danny hultzen","player_id":"543343","report":"Taken No. 2 overall in the 2011 Draft, Hultzen was supposed to be an advanced college lefty who would get to the big leagues quickly.

He has gotten hammered in his return to Double-A this year, however.\r\nCastellani's fastball sat around 90 mph in high school but now runs from 92-97 mph with arm-side run and sink that should help him deal with Coors Field. When he doesn't get around his low-80s slider, he shows the ability to throw it for strikes and to back-foot it against left-handers. His fading changeup slipped a little in 2017 but can be a solid pitch when he maintains his arm speed and slot when he throws it.\r\nColorado officials compare his less-than-smooth mechanics to Max Scherzer's, and like the three-time Cy Young Award winner in his younger days, Castellani's biggest need is consistent command. He had repeated his delivery well and thrown strikes in the past, but inconsistency with his mechanics has led to his struggles in 2018.

He'll throw an 80-grade fastball at times, approaching triple-digits, and showed that not only can he sit in the 95-97 mph range, he can maintain his velocity throughout a start and a season, though he threw just over 90 innings a year ago. Velocity-wise, his slider is where it should be, but it doesn't always have the action for it to be an out pitch. His changeup will flash average as well and it's just a matter of Romero refining his pitchability to become a complete starting pitcher, though he threw a lot more strikes than anticipated in his return.\r\nRomero was understandably treated with kid gloves in 2016.

His hard curve can be an out pitch, and he gets more strikeouts with that than with his fastball. Johnson didn't use his changeup that frequently in college, and he does need to develop it to have success as a starting pitcher. He's tall, but not overly physical, he's trying to add weight to his frame. Competitive and aggressive on the mound, he throw strikes consistently.

He got an opportunity to start in May and has run with it, earning a promotion from the Midwest to the California League.  Peacock has the chance to have three usable pitches when all is said and done. His bread-and-butter is his heavy sinker that sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph at times. His ability to command the pitch consistently down in the zone allows it to play up and is the reason he has one of the highest ground-ball rates in all of the Minor Leagues. His secondary stuff is developing, with a changeup a bit ahead of an improving slider.

Behind a combination of physicality and stuff, he continued to climb the ladder in 2018, beginning the season in the Class A California League and then earning a promotion to Double-A at age 22.  A physically large and imposing presence on the mound who operates from a three-quarters slot, the 6-foot-8 Baez can generate plus-plus velocity with ease, though inconsistent mechanics can cause his velo to fluctuate. When he's right, he'll sit in the mid-90s and touch 98 mph. His best secondary pitch is an upper-80s slider with two-plane action that flashes above-average potential, and he'll also show feel for a curveball and changeup, with the latter projecting as the better pitch.  Repeating his delivery and pounding the strike zone is something Baez does better than most hurlers of comparable size, but he does struggle at times to keep his long limbs in sync and throws with too much crossfire, resulting in diminished stuff and below-average fastball command.

His success in the Pacific Coast League earned him his first callup to St. Louis at age 26 in July, and Poncedeleon tied a bow on his miraculous comeback story by tossing seven no-hit innings against the Reds in his big league debut.  Poncedeleon's continued success throughout his career is a testimony to his stuff. He's consistently around the zone with a sinking fastball that touches the mid-90s and sits at 93-94 mph, while his above-average 90-91 mph cutter and average changeup are weapons for him against right- and left-handed hitters, respectively. He also has an upper-70s curveball at his disposal, but it's a below-average pitch, and he seldom threw it in the big leagues.  After his tremendous debut in July, Poncedeleon went on to toss 33 innings for the Cardinals, posting a 2.73 ERA across 11 outings (four starts).

If he does, he could be a setup man with two potential well above-average pitches.

The Terrapins' career leader in wins (30) and strikeouts (307), Shawaryn works from a low three-quarters slot that adds life to his pitches, all of which have the potential to be at least solid. His fastball usually runs from 90-94 mph with sink, though his velocity was down to 86-88 at times early in the college season. His sweeping slider can get swings and misses from both lefties and righties, and he shows some feel for a fading changeup.  Shawaryn has a strong, durable build that lets him maintain his stuff over the course of a game and a season.

Pinder responded to the challenge by winning the Texas League MVP Award as part of breakout season in which he paced the circuit in RBIs (86) and total bases (232), ranked second in average (.317), and hit 32 doubles along with a career-high 15 home runs. Pinder capped his season with a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League, earning the start at shortstop in the prestigious Fall Stars Game, and then opened the 2016 season at Triple-A Nashville.\r\nThanks to his hand-eye coordination and bat speed, Pinder does a good job of putting the bat on the ball despite being something of a free swinger. He makes a lot of loud contact and has some power, but his swing lends itself more to producing line drives than home runs. That said, there's enough juice in his bat for double-digit homer seasons in the big leagues, and he'll always be good for plenty of doubles.\r\nAfter primarily playing third base in college, Pinder was moved to second base full-time in 2014 only to shift back to shortstop last season.

He signed for $300,000 as a third-round pick and had an excellent pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, capping his season with a 10-strikeout performance over six innings in the GCL playoffs. Maese continued to impress in 2016, beginning the season in the New York-Penn League and advancing to full-season ball at age 19.\r\nThough he'll reach the mid-90s with his fastball, Maese tends to work more in the 90-94 mph range, displaying feel for pitching to both sides of the plate. Yet, it's the pitch's movement that makes it so dynamic, as Maese's fast arm and low three-quarters slot imparts excellent sinking action that has helped him generate more than twice as many ground-ball outs as air outs in his career. His slider is relatively new to his arsenal but shows the makings of a second plus pitch, thrown with power in the upper-80s, and he's also made strides in developing his changeup since signing.\r\nMaese's athleticism is special, and it's easy to envision the young righty growing into his projectable frame in the coming years.

Carlson has some serious offensive potential from both sides of the plate, with many evaluators believing he'll be able to get to an average hit tool because of his advanced approach. Carlson walked 11.5 percent of the time during his first full season. His strong knowledge of the strike zone should allow him to find more pitches to drive and tap into his power more consistently.

His secondary stuff, an upper-70s curve and a changeup he is capable of throwing with good arm speed and deception, is average at best. Deception and extension in his delivery have helped him in the past, and he's always been a solid strike-thrower.

He was named co-Pitcher of the Year of the Florida State League and led all Minor League pitchers in wins, also ranking third in both ERA and strikeouts. He was added to the Rays' 40-man roster after the season. \r\n\r\nRaw and projectable when he was drafted, the 6-foot-4 righty has matured physically in the past year and repeats his delivery more consistently as a result. Faria creates excellent plane toward the plate and works down in the zone with his fastball, which jumped into the 92-95 mph range in 2015. His command of the pitch lags behind its velocity right now, though the former stands to improve given his athleticism and easy delivery. Faria's 12-to-6 curveball is a work in progress and projects as slightly below average, but he can throw it for a strike and mix it effectively. His changeup in the mid 80s flashes plus and is thrown from the same slot as his fastball with similar arm speed. It's a weapon against both right- and left-handed hitters. \r\n\r\nFaria made a name for himself in 2015, and the Rays believe there's more to come from the 22-year-old. He has the potential to become a No. 4 starter with better fastball command and a sharper curveball, while his plus fastball-changeup combo also gives him upside in either a seventh- or eighth-inning role.","label":0},{"name":"stephen gonsalves","player_id":"624427","report":"Projectable left-handers aren't easy to find, but the Twins may have found one in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft in Gonsalves, who took a nice step forward in 2014 by reaching the Midwest League and competing well there, then built off of that by earning a promotion during the 2015 season.\r\n\r\nThe 6-foot-5 lefty has success pitching mostly with an average fastball, but he's starting to show there's more in the tank as he continues to physically mature and add some strength. The SoCal product needs to continue to work on his overall command and his secondary pitches. He throws a changeup as well as a curve, both of which could be at least Major League average, and he started tinkering with a slider\/cutter as well, which could eventually become his go-to breaking ball. \r\n\r\nMore than anything, Gonsalves just needs time on the mound to hone his craft.

Somewhat surprisingly, Bolton is the only one of the three to start his 2018 season in full-season ball, albeit after hanging back in extended spring camp. Projectable at 6-foot-3, his stuff has already taken a nice step forward since entering pro ball. Bolton will throw both a two- and four-seam fastball, 90-95 mph, with the potential for there to be more in the tank. His secondary stuff is developing, but both his slider and his changeup have the chance to be solid- to a tick-above-average offerings in the future.

He performed as expected in the New York-Penn League during his debut and got bumped to the Class A California League to help out Stockton in the postseason. Rivas has a polished left-handed bat with a sweet swing that routinely produces line drives. He has a solid approach at the plate with excellent discipline and pitch recognition. There hasn't been much power to date, but there is a little to dream on as he gets more physical and perhaps learns to backspin the ball a bit more, particularly on the pull side. He's a solid defender at first with a strong arm -- he pitched in relief for two years at Arizona -- and can also handle an outfield corner if need be. For Rivas to profile as an everyday player at first, or even in an outfield corner, his power output will have to tick up.

Despite Brigham's checkered medical history, the Marlins have remained steadfast in developing the right-hander as a starter.

He transitioned from reliever to starter in his first full pro season and was named Chicago's Minor League Pitcher of the Year after leading the system with 14 wins and a 2.16 ERA while zooming to Double-A.\r\nWilliams sits in the high 80s with his fastball, which peaks at 92, yet it grades as a true plus pitch because it has so much sink and he commands it so well. His sinker confounds hitters by diving at the plate, allowing him to post sterling numbers in his first two years as a pro: 2.03 ERA, .215 opponent average, a 6.0 K\/BB ratio, 0.2 homers and 1.1 walks allowed per nine innings. He performed well in Triple-A at the start of 2016 before coming down with shoulder soreness in May.\r\nWilliams lacks an average secondary pitch, though he can throw his serviceable curveball, slider and split-changeup for strikes.

He can drive the ball and there could be more over-the-fence pop if he can continue to make adjustments and refine his approach. There is some swing-and-miss to his game that concerns some, but he did cut his strikeout rate in the second half of 2017. \r\nReynolds has played all three outfield positions during his pro career and has enough speed to stay there should the Pirates want him to. He's probably a better defender in a corner, but profiles as a solid big league regular when all is said and done.","label":1},{"name":"josh ockimey","player_id":"656807","report":"Ockimey impressed the Red Sox with a strong pre-Draft workout in 2014, parlaying it into an over-slot $450,000 bonus in the fifth round.

That success didn't completely carry over to his first full season.\r\n\r\nWhen Sanger relaxes, he does what he's always done: hit. He's hit well everywhere he's gone and his second half in Orem allowed him to finish in the top 15 in the league in OPS. He has an advanced approach at the plate, draws walks and swings at good hitter's pitches. Sanger has below-average power, but there is some extra-base ability with more of a drive-the-ball-to-the-gaps approach. An average runner, he doesn't have the speed to play center field every day and it's unclear if his arm works well enough in right field, giving him a bit of a tweener profile.\r\n\r\nAt worst, Sanger has the skills to play all three outfield spots and could be a valuable offensive contributor as a fourth outfielder.

Rogers never took the mound that summer because the Marlins opted to give him additional rest, but he pitched increasingly well as the 2018 season progressed after making his pro debut with Class A Greensboro in May.   Rogers features an impressive fastball, one capable of reaching of the mid-90s but typically sits more in the low 90s. His heater plays up because of his long arms, deception and very good command of the pitch. The southpaw's secondary stuff is well behind his fastball, as Rogers will throw a slider and a curveball that tend to bleed together, with the former currently ahead of the latter. He has trouble staying on top of his curve, and some scouts believe he will likely be better off sticking to the slider at the next level. He also throws a changeup that is getting better and approaching average.

Despite an inconsistent junior season that included some time in Arkansas' rotation, he signed for $585,100, more than double his slot's value, as the Blue Jays' third-round pick in June, and then enjoyed a solid professional debut in the Short-Season Northwest League. \r\nJackson's best pitch is a hammer three-quarters breaking ball with curveball break and slider velocity in the low 90s. He usually operates at 93-95 mph with his fastball and can hit 97, though it can get straight at times. Jackson doesn't need a changeup much as a reliever, but he has shown some aptitude for throwing one.\r\nWhile Jackson has the size and athleticism to make it as a starter, scouts question whether he has the mechanics to pull off the transition. There's a lot going on with his delivery, which features a long arm path and a deep shoulder tilt, and it hampers his control and command.

Hiura fit that profile based on his ability at the plate alone, but a lack of a true defensive home, complicated by an elbow injury that limited him to designated hitter duties only at Cal Irvine in the spring, made it a little tougher for scouts to evaluate his overall game. Those issues were of little concern to the Brewers, and they were thrilled to land arguably the best hitter in the Draft with the No. 9 overall pick. \r\nHiura has hit everywhere he's been, including all three years at Irvine and a strong performance for Team USA last summer. He has a short, impactful right-handed stroke with a ton of bat speed and outstanding feel for the barrel. He projects to hit for a high average and shows at least average in-game power, with the ball coming off of his bat differently than most. Hiura has played center field in the past and some second base, where he has decent actions but also fringy footwork. Left field is another possibility, one that some evaluators believe could offer Hiura the fastest path to the Majors.\r\nWhile the prospect of Hiura needing Tommy John surgery was enough to scare some teams away leading up to the Draft, the Brewers, in the wake of a post-Draft MRI, are now confident that he can make a successful recovery without the procedure and believe he could return to the field at some point in 2017. With a clean bill of health, Hiura could be among the first hitters from the '17 Draft to reach the big leagues.","label":0},{"name":"matt tabor","player_id":"675652","report":"Tabor was a major pop-up guy in the 2017 Draft class, partially because of playing baseball in New England, where scouts had to wait for the weather to improve to see him, and partially because a growth spurt heading into his senior year at Milton Academy led to an uptick in his stuff. That landed him in the third round, where the D-backs gave him an above-pick value deal of $1 million to sign.\r\n \r\nTabor's added size led to him being up to 96 mph with his fastball at times this spring, sitting in the 92-93 mph range deep into starts. He has good feel for an average changeup. His breaking ball is slurvy right now, but he has a feel to spin it and he can land it for strikes, with scouts feeling it will likely work better as a slider. Tabor has an extremely quick arm that should work going forward. His command should be average at the next level.\r\n \r\nTabor could have gone higher in the Draft, but a rough start in front of decision-makers gave his stock a hit, which worked to the D-backs' advantage.

He spent the 2018 season sharing catching duties with MJ Melendez during his full-season debut. Rivero has the kind of intangibles teams love to see in their catchers. He learned English quickly to help him work with his pitching staff and he's an excellent game-caller and receiver. He also has a plus arm that allowed him to throw out more than 35 percent of potential basestealers in 2018. While the right-handed hitter's offense is behind his glove work, he has shown some potential with the bat. He has displayed excellent bat control and doesn't strike out much. He'll never be a big power guy and understands his role, with the profile of being a bottom of the order hitter. Rivero and Melendez fed off of each other in 2018 and the Royals hope they continue to do so, with Rivero helping Melendez become a better overall defender and Melendez helping to push Rivero offensively. It reminds some in the organization of the relationship between Salvador Perez and then-catcher Wil Myers in the Minors, with the hope Rivero can still develop into a big league regular as a result.","label":0},{"name":"christian bethancourt","player_id":"542194","report":"A native of Panama, Bethancourt has been a fixture of the World roster at the All-Star Futures Game for the last three years.

Tucker has an unconventional left-handed swing, but he makes it work with his bat speed and his uncanny hand-eye coordination. He recognizes pitches well and makes contact more easily than most players with his power potential. He has a solid plan at the plate and traded some patience for pop last year, slugging .528 after recording a .408 mark in his first two seasons. While Tucker's offensive prowess could make him a star, he has the chance for average or better tools across the board once Houston moves him to an outfield corner.

While he's still learning the strike zone and refining his approach, he has tremendous instincts with a very direct swing, one that squares the ball up consistently. As he matures, he should continue to grow into power, with the ceiling to be above average in that department, and left-handed pitching doesn't seem to bother him. Where Blankenhorn profiles best defensively is much more in question. A high school shortstop, Blankenhorn mostly played third during his pro debut, then saw more time at second in 2016.
