0	buxton	byron	621439	2013	{'Hit': '4', 'Power': '3', 'Run': '7', 'Arm': '6', 'Field': '6', 'Overall': '5'}	While Carlos Correa was a deserving choice for No. 1 overall pick in many respects, it was Buxton most considered the top overall talent in the 2012 Draft class and the Twins were more than thrilled to add his potential to the system. Buxton has a full toolbox, with the ability to do everything well on the baseball field. His speed is his best present tool and that will help him be a threat on the bases and play a very good center field. He has plenty of bat speed and while his power isn't going to show up just yet, most feel he'll grow into it as he develops. More than anything, he just needs to go out and play, so he can learn how to use his tremendous tools consistently on the field. The Twins tend to be conservative in their development plans, so they will show the necessary patience in cultivating Buxton's considerable talents.	prospects	2012, 1st (2) - MIN	2015	OF	OF	19	2	2013	1			MIN	621439.0	buxtb001	buxtoby01	14161.0	2015.0	2019.0

He appeared poised to continue his Mike Trout-like climb to the big leagues when a wrist injury initially suffered in Spring Training forced him to miss a large amount of the 2014 season. Assuming Buxton doesn't have any lingering effects upon his return, he'll get back to showing he's a legitimate five-tool player. He has a simple, direct swing and creates excellent bat speed. Buxton's power has already been better than expected, and scouts expect it to improve more as he grows. His speed grades out at the top of the scale and he knows how to use it on the basepaths. Defensively, Buxton covers plenty of ground in center field and has good instincts in the outfield. The Twins are traditionally conservative in their developmental timelines, though Buxton had put himself on an accelerated track to the Major Leagues before his injury.	prospects	2012, 1st (2) - MIN	2015	OF	OF	1	1	2014	1			MIN	621439.0	buxtb001	buxtoby01	14161.0	2015.0	2019.0
2	buxton	byron	621439	2015	{'Hit': '70', 'Power': '60', 'Run': '80', 'Arm': '70', 'Field': '70', 'Overall': '70'}	Ever since Buxton was taken with the No. 2 overall pick of the 2012 Draft, he's been seen as one of the best all-around talents in the Minor Leagues. He held the No. 1 spot in the Top 100, despite a rash of unrelated injuries, as a result.   When he's 100 percent, Buxton is the epitome of the five-tool player. He has a simple, quick swing that generates a ton of bat speed. His power, which often doesn't come until later in development, has already started showing up in games, and there's more in the tank there. He has as much speed as anyone in the Minors and he's a skilled baserunner to boot. He's a plus defender in center field, using his speed for outstanding range, while also possessing a cannon for an arm.   The key now is for Buxton to stay healthy. He missed most of the 2014 season with a wrist injury, then suffering an outfield collision during his Double-A debut, followed by breaking a finger in the Arizona Fall League. He rode a hot streak to the big leagues in June, only to land on the DL again with a sprained thumb.	prospects	2012, 1st (2) - MIN	2015	OF	OF	1	1	2015	1			MIN	621439.0	buxtb001	buxtoby01	14161.0	2015.0	2019.0
3	taveras	oscar	570805	2013	{'Hit': '5', 'Power': '5', 'Run': '5', 'Arm': '5', 'Field': '5', 'Overall': '5'}	The St. Louis Cardinals have developed some All-Star-caliber position players in recent years, starting of course with Albert Pujols and including Yadier Molina. Taveras has every chance to be next in line, the kind of talent that doesn't come around all too often. Always young for his level, he has hit everywhere he's gone, and in 2012, the power most felt he had started to show up consistently in games. Taveras has a ton of bat speed and rarely strikes out. His improvement in terms of plate discipline has made him an even more dangerous hitter, one who looks like a sure-fire middle-of-the-order run producer. With that offensive profile and his strong arm, Taveras looks like a future right fielder, but he played a lot of center field in 2012 and could see time there as well, at least in the short run. Regardless of where he plays, the Cardinals will have a hard time keeping his bat out of the lineup for too long.

4	sano	miguel	593934	2013	{'Hit': '3', 'Power': '5', 'Run': '3', 'Arm': '6', 'Field': '2', 'Overall': '4'}	Sano has been in the spotlight since signing out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. While his pro career is still relatively in its nascent stages, one thing is clear: reports of Sano's power have not been exaggerated. It's easily plus and it shows up in games now, with more coming. He can hit the ball out of any park to all fields, and while he swings and misses a good amount, he improved his plate discipline and is drawing more walks. His defense is a bigger question mark. Sano is a big young man, but he is fairly agile and does have the tools -- particularly a plus arm -- to stay there. He will need, however, to improve his footwork and focus in order to do so. Sano turns just 20 in 2013, so there's no reason to rush him, with the payoff being a very special run producer at the hot corner.

But since reaching the professional ranks, he has shown what all the fuss is about. Sano has prodigious raw power and knows how to use it in games. He hit 35 home runs between Class A Advanced Fort Myers and Double-A New Britain in 2013. With Sano's power, however, comes a lot of swings and misses. He has struck out more than 140 times in both of his years in full-season ball. Sano's defense continues to be a question mark. He has made strides at third base, but some scouts believe he is destined to move across the diamond to first base. An elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in Spring Training and will sideline Sano for the 2014 season complicates his future, but Minnesota will find a place to play him if he keeps pounding the ball.	prospects		2015	3B	3B	4	2	2014	7		Oct. 9, 2009 - MIN	MIN	593934.0	sanom001	sanomi01	12164.0	2015.0	2018.0
6	walker	taijuan	592836	2013	{'Fastball': '6', 'Curveball': '5', 'Changeup': '4', 'Control': '4', 'Overall': '5'}	The Mariners didn't have a first-round pick in the 2010 Draft, but that's not something that bothers them all that much thanks to the development of Walker, their first selection that June. The 2012 Futures Gamer was the youngest pitcher in the Southern League and was dominant in the first half, though he did falter in the second half. He has the makings of an excellent three-pitch mix, with a plus fastball, complemented by a curve and changeup, both of which have the chance to be at least above-average. He still needs to tighten up his command, but his athleticism - he was a basketball standout in high school - should allow him to do improve on that and become the frontline starter people project him as.

An argument can be made that Lindor is the best defensive shortstop in the Minors. Not only does he have an outstanding arm and well above-average range, but those tools play up because of his off-the-charts instincts and feel for the position. But he's far from all glove. He has a quick swing and advanced approach that leads to hard line drives to all fields. He has some power, particularly to the pull side, but can also play small ball. An above-average runner, those instincts allow him to be a basestealing threat. His tools combined with his plus plus makeup have most believing he'll make an impact in Cleveland in a hurry.	prospects	2011, 1st (8) - CLE	2014	SS	SS	14	1	2013	5			CLE	596019.0	lindf001	lindofr01	12916.0	2015.0	2019.0

He played in the All-Star Futures Game as an 18-year-old in '12, and he returned there this July. Lindor is an elite defensive shortstop, and many scouts consider him to be the best defender in the Minor Leagues. He has a strong arm, and he ranges well to both sides. At the plate, Lindor makes a lot of contact, and he shows good pitch recognition. He doesn't have a lot of power, but some believe he will develop solid pop as he fills out. Lindor is a good runner, and his baseball instincts help that play up on the basepaths. He also earns praise for his leadership and makeup. After speeding through the lower levels of the Minor Leagues, Lindor is on the cusp of making an impact in Cleveland.	prospects	2011, 1st (8) - CLE	2015	SS	SS	10	1	2014	4			CLE	596019.0	lindf001	lindofr01	12916.0	2015.0	2019.0
9	bogaerts	xander	593428	2013	{'Hit': '4', 'Power': '4', 'Run': '5', 'Arm': '6', 'Field': '4', 'Overall': '5'}	The Aruba native and 2012 Futures Game participant has some serious tools and he's used them to rush up the Red Sox's organizational ladder, reaching Double-A in 2012 at age 19. He has the ability to make hard contact and can shoot the ball to all fields with excellent bat speed and a smooth swing. He has significant raw power he's still learning to tap into and he will be a better overall hitter as his plate discipline continues to improve, something that happened in the Carolina League in 2012, but not as much once he moved up a level. His plus arm works just fine from shortstop and while he's an average runner, he has better range than one would expect for a player his size. If he has to move over to third, his bat looks like it will play just fine there, though Will Middlebrooks is standing in the way there.

10	bradley	archie	605151	2013	{'Fastball': '6', 'Curveball': '4', 'Changeup': '4', 'Control': '3', 'Overall': '5'}	By all accounts, Bradley's first full season in pro ball was a success, as the second Oklahoma high schooler taken in the top 10 of the 2011 Draft was a Midwest League All-Star and finished second in the Minors with a .181 batting average against. He finished second in the league in strikeouts and while he also topped the circuit in walks, he projects to have at least average command. His fastball, which tops out at 95 mph, has some serious sink to generate groundball outs. His curve has sharp bite to it, though he doesn't always command it well. He has a feel for a changeup with some fade to it, giving him the chance to have three average or better offerings at his disposal. Very athletic - he was a standout QB in high school - that should allow him to maximize his tools on the mound.	prospects	2011, 1st (7) - ARI	2015	RHP	RHP	24	2	2013	7			ARI	605151.0	brada001	bradlar01	12918.0	2015.0	2019.0

The steep downhill angle he throws from and the good sinking action on the pitch combine to produce a lot of ground balls. Bradley complements his plus fastball with an above-average 12-to-6 curveball, and a changeup that will likely be at least a Major League-average offering. Bradley has improved his command, and he earns praise for his demeanor on the mound. His stuff, size and makeup make him one of the best pitchers in the Minor Leagues. Elbow soreness slowed Bradley's progress in the first half, but he has looked as good as ever since getting back on the mound.	prospects	2011, 1st (7) - ARI	2014	RHP	RHP	5	1	2014	9			ARI	605151.0	brada001	bradlar01	12918.0	2015.0	2019.0

Bradley then took a line drive off of his head a few starts later, then dealt with a shoulder problem to derail him yet again.  The good news for the 2011 first-rounder is he finished off the season with two solid starts in Triple-A and threw well in instructional league play. He'll also be just 23 for most of the 2016 season and his pure stuff keeps bouncing back. He's still capable of hitting the mid-90s consistently with his fastball and using his 6-foot-4 frame to throw downhill. His power curveball can miss bats while his changeup and the slider/cutter type pitch he added in the Arizona Fall League in 2014 give him two more potential Major League average offerings.  Command continues to be the biggest issue for Bradley, whose walk rate has kept him from working deep into starts. Some foresee a move to the bullpen as a result, but it's too early to give up on him as a starter.	prospects	2011, 1st (7) - ARI	2016	RHP	RHP	15	1	2015	39			ARI	605151.0	brada001	bradlar01	12918.0	2015.0	2019.0

Sure, it allowed them to be more creative with later selections, but Correa was one of the most talented players in the Draft class. He can flat out play shortstop, with at least above-average tools defensively, from his range and actions to his plus arm. While his glove is ahead of his overall offensive skillset right now, he's far from being a defense-only guy. He's an above-average runner now, though he might slow down a tick over time. He has the chance to have above-average power at a premium position. The biggest question is over how much he'll hit. Even if he's just an average hitter, with his other tools, that makes him an elite shortstop in the future, and with off-the-charts makeup and work ethic, it might be a mistake to underestimate what his ceiling is.	prospects	2012, 1st (1) - HOU	2016	SS	SS	30	2	2013	8			HOU	621043.0	corrc001	correca01	14162.0	2015.0	2019.0

But Correa was worthy of the selection, and he showed why in 2013, his first full professional season. As an 18-year-old, Correa helped lead Class A Quad Cities to the Midwest League title, and he led the circuit with a .872 OPS. He was on his way to a similar performance in 2014 when a broken right fibula ended his season.  Though Correa is still physically maturing, he already has above-average power. Correa has a balanced swing and he has a good approach at the plate. He is an average runner. Correa has a strong arm, soft hands and good defensive instincts, all of which could help him stay at shortstop. Some scouts feel he will outgrow the position, but so far, he has shown he can handle shortstop.   Correa earns high marks for his work ethic and makeup, which will help him bounce back from his injury. He has a chance to be an impact player regardless of his future position.	prospects	2012, 1st (1) - HOU	2016	SS	SS	8	1	2014	2			HOU	621043.0	corrc001	correca01	14162.0	2015.0	2019.0

Perhaps people will take sides in the Javier Baez vs. Francisco Lindor debate for years, but there's no question both are extremely talented young middle infielders. Baez didn't head to full-season ball right away, but when he did, he quickly hit his way up a level, then showed off some pop in the Arizona Fall League before getting hurt. Baez has plus bat speed that should allow him to hit for a ton of power and average, especially if he can refine his approach and gain better plate discipline. Many were ready to move Baez to third right away, but he showed some ability at shortstop, with a very good arm and good hands. His instincts allow his average speed to play up on both sides of the ball. Even if he has to move to third, his bat should profile just fine there.

The big right-hander who came from the Texas high school ranks finished the season in Double-A, with three outstanding starts to finish the year. His fastball is a plus pitch and he'll touch 96-97 mph with it. Taillon's secondary stuff is still developing, but both his breaking ball and offspeed offering have the chance to be above-average pitches. He gained more confidence in his curve as the year went on and he showed better feel for his changeup as well. Taillon is still growing into his body and tweaking his delivery, leading to some overall command issues, though that shouldn't be a long-term concern. Another year of experience under his belt might be all he needs to be ready for Pittsburgh.	prospects	2010, 1st (2) - PIT	2014	RHP	RHP	15	2	2013	10			PIT	592791.0	tailj001	taillja01	11674.0	2016.0	2019.0

Harper and Machado are both already All-Stars. Taillon was on the verge of joining them in the Major Leagues before it was discovered that he needed Tommy John surgery in April 2014. Taillon is a classic power right-hander, mixing good size with a mid-90s fastball and a hard curveball. His changeup has also made strides, giving him a chance for three above-average pitches. Taillon's fastball has good sinking action, but it tends to flatten out and become easier to hit if he leaves it up in the zone. Taillon commands his pitches well and earns praise for his poise and confidence on the mound. The Bucs hope he will be able to join Gerrit Cole at the front of their big league rotation once he recovers from surgery.	prospects	2010, 1st (2) - PIT	2014	RHP	RHP	16	2	2014	28			PIT	592791.0	tailj001	taillja01	11674.0	2016.0	2019.0

Instead, Taillon had Tommy John surgery in early April and missed the entire season. Surgery and rehab went well, and he was working his way back to pitching competitively 2015 when an inguinal hernia required surgery in July.   When healthy, Taillon has three above-average to plus pitches at his disposal, all coming from a big 6-foot-5 frame. His fastball sits in the mid 90s, and he maintains his velocity deep into starts. He has an outstanding curve, a big overhand breaking ball that can miss bats as well. His changeup hasn't been as consistent, but it has shown flashes of being at least a Major League average pitch. While wildness hasn't been a real issue, Taillon's overall command hadn't been as sharp.   Command and feel for pitching often is what takes the longest to come back post-surgery. The good news is that, at age 23 for all of the 2015 season, Taillon is still ahead of the curve.	prospects	2010, 1st (2) - PIT	2016	RHP	RHP	31	2	2015	45			PIT	592791.0	tailj001	taillja01	11674.0	2016.0	2019.0

He can flat-out hit, adjusting extremely well to any and all pitching. He drives the ball to all fields and while he hasn't shown too much in the way of home run power to date, there is definitely pop in his bat that will come. Castellanos started his pro career as a third baseman and could have been an average defender there, but he moved to the outfield in 2012, largely to find the quickest path to the big leagues for his bat. There isn't a spot waiting for him just yet, but don't be surprised if he hits his way into Detroit's plans in the near future.

He was a key piece of the deal that sent R.A. Dickey to Toronto in December 2012, and he started the Futures Game for the U.S. team the next summer. Snydergaard uses his height well, throwing downhill with some movement. Though his fastball is plus, thrown up to 96 mph consistently, he's more than just a thrower. His power curve has improved as he's added velocity to it, and it could be an above-average breaking ball in the future. He has a power changeup as well, which is still a work in progress but could give him a third above-average offering. Despite his size, he has an easy delivery and he throws strikes. His combination of stuff, pitchability and aggressiveness on the mound point to a future as a frontline starter.	prospects	2010, 1st (38) - TOR	2014	RHP	RHP	29	3	2013	12			NYM	592789.0	syndn001	syndeno01	11762.0	2015.0	2019.0

Dickey deal in December 2012, Syndergaard made a splash in his first season in his new organization. He reached Double-A Binghamton and started the 2013 All-Star Futures Game at Citi Field for the U.S. team. Syndergaard is a classic power right-hander, and he uses his big frame to throw downhill and induce ground balls. His fastball regularly reaches 98 mph and runs inside on right-handed hitters. Syndergaard's 12-to-6 curveball is his best secondary pitch, though his changeup has the potential to be a third plus pitch in his arsenal. He has excellent command and posted a 4.75 K-to-BB ratio in 2013. Many expected Syndergaard to follow the path that Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler blazed and reach Queens early this summer. But some minor injuries and on-field struggles at Triple-A Las Vegas slowed down Syndergaard's progress this season. He still profiles as a front-line starter and remains on track to make his Major League debut at a younger age than either Harvey or Wheeler.	prospects	2010, 1st Sup (38) - TOR	2014	RHP	RHP	11	1	2014	10			NYM	592789.0	syndn001	syndeno01	11762.0	2015.0	2019.0

The speedy center fielder topped the system in stolen bases and finished second in a host of other offensive categories. He has the chance to be a true five-tooler on the field. With a long, lean frame, he’s an aggressive swinger who started to learn the values of plate discipline, making him a much more dangerous hitter. He should hit for average and at least a little power. His plus speed will make him a long-term basestealing threat and an outstanding defensive outfielder.	prospects		2014	OF	OF	65	4	2013	13		Apr. 11, 2009 - PIT	PIT	570256.0	polag001	polangr01	12907.0	2014.0	2019.0
23	gausman	kevin	592332	2013	{'Fastball': '7', 'Curveball': '4', 'Changeup': '6', 'Control': '4', 'Overall': '5'}	What a difference two years can make. Coming out of high school, Gausman was a highly thought of pitcher with a ton of arm strength, but little else. After two seasons at LSU, he emerged as the top college arm taken in the 2012 Draft. He still has the power, his fastball is an easy plus pitch, but he’s learned a lot more about his overall craft. He backs up his heater with another plus pitch, a changeup, which fades and sinks. His breaking stuff has always lagged behind a bit as he toyed with both a curve and slider in college, with the latter likely being the better option going forward. Improving that, along with his overall command, are all he needs to be a frontline starter in the big leagues in the near future.	prospects	2012, 1st (4) - BAL	2013	RHP	RHP	37	2	2013	14			BAL	592332.0	gausk001	gausmke01	14107.0	2013.0	2019.0
24	bundy	dylan	605164	2013	{'Fastball': '7', 'Curveball': '5', 'Changeup': '6', 'Control': '5', 'Overall': '5'}	It's not often that a pitcher makes it to the big leagues in his first full season as a professional. It's even less common when one taken out of high school does it, but that's exactly what Bundy accomplished in 2012. The Oklahoma prep product started the year in the South Atlantic League and finished it in Baltimore. Along the way, he showed an ability to throw several pitches for strikes. His fastball is easily plus, thrown up to 98 mph, and he maintains velocity deep into his starts with a clean and easy delivery. His curve should be at least above-average in the future, though he's still learning to throw it consistently. He has good arm speed on his changeup, which should be another above-average or better pitch. He looks every bit the top of the rotation starter the Orioles hoped they were getting when they gave him a Major League contract.	prospects	2011, 1st (4) - BAL	2014	RHP	RHP	2	1	2013	15			BAL	605164.0	bundd001	bundydy01	12917.0	2012.0	2019.0
