# Data

To the best of my knowledge, this is the only existing dataset of its kind for baseball prospect profiles. The data was acquired from [MLB.com](http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2019)'s and [FanGraphs'](https://www.fangraphs.com/prospects/the-board/2019-in-season-prospect-list/summary?sort=-1,1&type=0&team=) top prospect rankings dating back to 2013. This includes rankings for top minor league players, draft prospects, international prospects, and team-specific rankings. Nearly 10,000 player profiles were accumulated.
