buxton,byron,621439,2013,"{'Hit': '4', 'Power': '3', 'Run': '7', 'Arm': '6', 'Field': '6', 'Overall': '5'}","While Carlos Correa was a deserving choice for No. 1 overall pick in many respects, it was Buxton most considered the top overall talent in the 2012 Draft class and the Twins were more than thrilled to add his potential to the system. Buxton has a full toolbox, with the ability to do everything well on the baseball field. His speed is his best present tool and that will help him be a threat on the bases and play a very good center field. He has plenty of bat speed and while his power isn't going to show up just yet, most feel he'll grow into it as he develops. More than anything, he just needs to go out and play, so he can learn how to use his tremendous tools consistently on the field. The Twins tend to be conservative in their development plans, so they will show the necessary patience in cultivating Buxton's considerable talents.",prospects,"2012, 1st (2) - MIN",2015,OF,OF,19,2,2013,1,,,MIN,621439,buxtb001,buxtoby01,14161,2015,2019
buxton,byron,621439,2014,"{'Hit': '70', 'Power': '60', 'Run': '80', 'Arm': '70', 'Field': '75', 'Overall': '75'}","Buxton took the Minor Leagues by storm in his first full professional season, showing why many evaluators had rated him as the top talent in the 2012 Draft class. He appeared poised to continue his Mike Trout-like climb to the big leagues when a wrist injury initially suffered in Spring Training forced him to miss a large amount of the 2014 season.
Assuming Buxton doesn't have any lingering effects upon his return, he'll get back to showing he's a legitimate five-tool player. He has a simple, direct swing and creates excellent bat speed. Buxton's power has already been better than expected, and scouts expect it to improve more as he grows. His speed grades out at the top of the scale and he knows how to use it on the basepaths. Defensively, Buxton covers plenty of ground in center field and has good instincts in the outfield.
The Twins are traditionally conservative in their developmental timelines, though Buxton had put himself on an accelerated track to the Major Leagues before his injury.",prospects,"2012, 1st (2) - MIN",2015,OF,OF,1,1,2014,1,,,MIN,621439,buxtb001,buxtoby01,14161,2015,2019
buxton,byron,621439,2015,"{'Hit': '70', 'Power': '60', 'Run': '80', 'Arm': '70', 'Field': '70', 'Overall': '70'}","Ever since Buxton was taken with the No. 2 overall pick of the 2012 Draft, he's been seen as one of the best all-around talents in the Minor Leagues. He held the No. 1 spot in the Top 100, despite a rash of unrelated injuries, as a result. When he's 100 percent, Buxton is the epitome of the five-tool player. He has a simple, quick swing that generates a ton of bat speed. His power, which often doesn't come until later in development, has already started showing up in games, and there's more in the tank there. He has as much speed as anyone in the Minors and he's a skilled baserunner to boot. He's a plus defender in center field, using his speed for outstanding range, while also possessing a cannon for an arm. The key now is for Buxton to stay healthy. He missed most of the 2014 season with a wrist injury, then suffering an outfield collision during his Double-A debut, followed by breaking a finger in the Arizona Fall League. He rode a hot streak to the big leagues in June, only to land on the DL again with a sprained thumb.",prospects,"2012, 1st (2) - MIN",2015,OF,OF,1,1,2015,1,,,MIN,621439,buxtb001,buxtoby01,14161,2015,2019
taveras,oscar,570805,2013,"{'Hit': '5', 'Power': '5', 'Run': '5', 'Arm': '5', 'Field': '5', 'Overall': '5'}","The St. Louis Cardinals have developed some All-Star-caliber position players in recent years, starting of course with Albert Pujols and including Yadier Molina. Taveras has every chance to be next in line, the kind of talent that doesn't come around all too often. Always young for his level, he has hit everywhere he's gone, and in 2012, the power most felt he had started to show up consistently in games. Taveras has a ton of bat speed and rarely strikes out. His improvement in terms of plate discipline has made him an even more dangerous hitter, one who looks like a sure-fire middle-of-the-order run producer. With that offensive profile and his strong arm, Taveras looks like a future right fielder, but he played a lot of center field in 2012 and could see time there as well, at least in the short run. Regardless of where he plays, the Cardinals will have a hard time keeping his bat out of the lineup for too long.

sano,miguel,593934,2013,"{'Hit': '3', 'Power': '5', 'Run': '3', 'Arm': '6', 'Field': '2', 'Overall': '4'}","Sano has been in the spotlight since signing out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. While his pro career is still relatively in its nascent stages, one thing is clear: reports of Sano's power have not been exaggerated. It's easily plus and it shows up in games now, with more coming. He can hit the ball out of any park to all fields, and while he swings and misses a good amount, he improved his plate discipline and is drawing more walks. His defense is a bigger question mark. Sano is a big young man, but he is fairly agile and does have the tools -- particularly a plus arm -- to stay there. He will need, however, to improve his footwork and focus in order to do so. Sano turns just 20 in 2013, so there's no reason to rush him, with the payoff being a very special run producer at the hot corner.

But since reaching the professional ranks, he has shown what all the fuss is about.
Sano has prodigious raw power and knows how to use it in games. He hit 35 home runs between Class A Advanced Fort Myers and Double-A New Britain in 2013. With Sano's power, however, comes a lot of swings and misses. He has struck out more than 140 times in both of his years in full-season ball.
Sano's defense continues to be a question mark. He has made strides at third base, but some scouts believe he is destined to move across the diamond to first base. An elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in Spring Training and will sideline Sano for the 2014 season complicates his future, but Minnesota will find a place to play him if he keeps pounding the ball.",prospects,,2015,3B,3B,4,2,2014,7,,"Oct. 9, 2009 - MIN",MIN,593934,sanom001,sanomi01,12164,2015,2018
walker,taijuan,592836,2013,"{'Fastball': '6', 'Curveball': '5', 'Changeup': '4', 'Control': '4', 'Overall': '5'}","The Mariners didn't have a first-round pick in the 2010 Draft, but that's not something that bothers them all that much thanks to the development of Walker, their first selection that June. The 2012 Futures Gamer was the youngest pitcher in the Southern League and was dominant in the first half, though he did falter in the second half. He has the makings of an excellent three-pitch mix, with a plus fastball, complemented by a curve and changeup, both of which have the chance to be at least above-average. He still needs to tighten up his command, but his athleticism - he was a basketball standout in high school - should allow him to do improve on that and become the frontline starter people project him as.

lindor,francisco,596019,2013,"{'Hit': '4', 'Power': '3', 'Run': '5', 'Arm': '6', 'Field': '6', 'Overall': '6'}","Any baseball field Lindor is on, he looks like he belongs, whether it was as the youngest regular in the Midwest League in 2012 or in a big league stadium at the All-Star Futures Game. An argument can be made that Lindor is the best defensive shortstop in the Minors. Not only does he have an outstanding arm and well above-average range, but those tools play up because of his off-the-charts instincts and feel for the position. But he's far from all glove. He has a quick swing and advanced approach that leads to hard line drives to all fields. He has some power, particularly to the pull side, but can also play small ball. An above-average runner, those instincts allow him to be a basestealing threat. His tools combined with his plus plus makeup have most believing he'll make an impact in Cleveland in a hurry.",prospects,"2011, 1st (8) - CLE",2014,SS,SS,14,1,2013,5,,,CLE,596019,lindf001,lindofr01,12916,2015,2019

He played in the All-Star Futures Game as an 18-year-old in '12, and he returned there this July.
Lindor is an elite defensive shortstop, and many scouts consider him to be the best defender in the Minor Leagues. He has a strong arm, and he ranges well to both sides. At the plate, Lindor makes a lot of contact, and he shows good pitch recognition. He doesn't have a lot of power, but some believe he will develop solid pop as he fills out. Lindor is a good runner, and his baseball instincts help that play up on the basepaths. He also earns praise for his leadership and makeup.
