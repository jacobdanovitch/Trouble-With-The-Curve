# Trouble with the Curve

This folder contains the code required for training the models described in the paper. All deep learning models were assembled using `AllenNLP`, and can be run with `python train.py`. Training logs can be viewed [here](https://ui.neptune.ml/jacobdanovitch/Trouble-with-the-Curve/experiments).

Upcoming additions:

* CLI documentation
* Sk-learn models
* Training with additional metadata as well as text features
